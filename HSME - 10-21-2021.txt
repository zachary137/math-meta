Math Happens is based in Austin and often works with UT Austin
	I had the chance to work with them on some things in the past

oblique asymptote
	Example of vocab that may be unfamiliar to those outside of the "inner circle"
Cool problem: How do we optimally do pooled testing, so that we can minimize the number of tests we need to conduct?
	Worst case scenario
	Expected value
	Modifications needed if we want to factor in false positives/negatives (including risks...)
	How can we adapt this problem to be more friendly to English learners (or any kind of mixed language environment)?

The excitement and process of modeling is the core of what draws mathematicians to "pure mathematics"

ASSA model
Systems Pyramid
	Events < Patterns < Structures & Tools < Mental Models
	Think of seeing the top of an iceberg (rather than climbing up a mountain)

Having the courage to tell people we are not interested
How do we motivate students and build a positive student culture?
	Certain mental models may incentivize different things, leading to toxicity once you cross a certain threshold
How do we confront students when they don't know things we expect them to know (soft or hard demand)
	Guilt and shame
	Embarrassment
	Complicated by longer-term relationships and past history
	Maybe emphasizing practice instead of knowing (or understanding) is better

Distinctions that mathematicians make:
	Knowing vs. understanding
	"That's interesting" vs. "There's something there" vs. "I want to investigate that"

Who defines the achievement gap?
How is the achievement gap defined?
Why do we choose to focus on certain gaps and not other gaps?

CPM = College Prepatory Mathematics
	Do students who go through this system perform better on standardized tests?
	No more "plug and chug"
	Keep people engaged (and try not to have certain students dominate the process)
	Where do content, knowledge, and performance fit into the picture?

You should test the things you value, not simply value the things you test.
	How do we test communication skills?

Bringing in various kinds of professionals to see how they think about math

Example of deficiency
	Can factor a^2-b^2
	Can't factor a^4-b^2
