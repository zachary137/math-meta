We define the \infty-category DAff of affine derived schemes to be the opposite of SCR. This embeds into derived prestacks over SCR by Yoneda.
One can show that affine derived schemes satisfy fpqc descent (and thus many other forms of descent like Zariski descent).

We define (Zariski) derived stacks to be derived prestacks satisfying Zariski descent.
We define derived schemes to be derived stacks admitting a derived affine atlas.
One can show that derived schemes satisfy fpqc descent.
Warning: Zariski derived stacks and fpqc derived stacks are not the same in general.
