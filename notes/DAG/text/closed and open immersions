I was trained to call these closed and open embeddings, but I will try my best to follow convention.

Getting right the notions of closed and open immersion is one of the key starting points for any theory of algebraic geometry. 
In the classical setting, one proceeds in steps to define what it means for a morphism f: X\to Y of schemes to be a closed immersion.
  1. If X\iso\Spec B and Y\iso\Spec A then we need the underlying ring map A\to B to be a surjection (which is equivalent to B\iso A/I for some ideal I\normal A).
  2. In general, we need f to be affine and have pullback by affines which looks like a closed immersion as above.
  3. Check that these two notions are compatible.
If we adopt the formalism of locally ringed spaces then we can give a different yet equivalent topological description. 
The equivalence of the two notions is not a priori obvious.

In the derived setting, we should be able to follow the above recipe for general derived prestacks, demanding surjectivity on \pi_0 for affine derived schemes.
We want closed immersions of derived schemes to induce closed immersions on underlying classical schemes (and vice-versa because...).
What happens when we pass from derived prestacks to the classical realm?
