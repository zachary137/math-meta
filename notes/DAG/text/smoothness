In the classical setting, smoothness (which is a "relative notion") is a combination of formal smoothness plus an appropriate finiteness condition.

Can various kinds of singularity (nodal, cuspidal, etc.) be detected at the formal level? 
More generally, can we describe "singularity types" by specifying the (non-)existence of certain formal lifts?

Under suitable conditions, smoothness is the same as regularity (an "absolute notion"). Does this generalize to the derived setting?
