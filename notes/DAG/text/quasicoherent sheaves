Let X be a scheme.
QCoh(X) is a Grothendieck abelian category (c.f. https://amathew.wordpress.com/2011/07/30/quasi-coherent-sheaves-presentable-categories-and-a-result-of-gabber/)
	Roughly, there is a nice system of generators and filtered colimits are exact
	Implies that there are enough injectives

We want to recover all of the nice properties of QCoh(X) when X is a scheme (or even a stack!) from the derived setting.

To a simplicial commutative ring A we can associate the category Mod_A, which is stable and symmetric monoidal. Moreover, it is an arena (i.e., presentable).

Given an affine derived scheme X, define QCoh(X) to be Mod_A, where X is equivalent to Spec A and QCoh(X) is independent of A in a way that can be made precise.
Given a derived prestack X, define QCoh(X) to be \flim_{S\to X}\QCoh(S) for S an affine derived scheme, with limit taken in the category of arenas.
This is stable since stability is preserved under limits of (\infty,1)-categories.
This inherits symmetric monoidal structure from the module categories (module structure?).
This extends the previous definition because...
Expanding everything out gives us an explicit description in terms of cocycles.
QCoh can be viewed as RKE of Mod along Yoneda embedding \Spec: \SCR^{\op}\inj\PStk.
	What exactly is the target category here?

Forgetful functor from symmetric monoidal \infty-categories to plain \infty-categories preserves and detects limits.
Monadic functors are conservative.

QCoh can be used to restate the notion of Zariski open covering.
	Uses notion of conservativity

ANY morphism of f: Y\to X of prestacks automatically induces an adjoint pair with f^* the left adjoint and f_* the right adjoint.
	Are these symmetric monoidal? The functor f^* certainly is but maybe not f_*...
	Are these (co-)continuous (might need to index by cardinal...)?

Derived prestack X has structure presheaf \O_X in QCoh(X) which is unit for the symmetric monoidal structure.

Let p: X\to S be a morphism of derived prestacks and F a quasicoherent module over S. 
We have sections \Gamma(X,F) defined by Hom_{QCoh(X)}(\O_X,p^*F).

Proposition: For derived schemes we need only sample over affine open derived subschemes.
	This should be the same as showing that QCoh is a Zariski sheaf.
	
What is the difference between "sheafiness" and excision?
