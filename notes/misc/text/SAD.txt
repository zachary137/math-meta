Why do constructible sheaves form a nice class of sheaves?
	Excision
	"Noetherian" characterization at "finite level"
	Preservation under higher direct images with proper support (and in many other cases)

Passing between geometry and algebra for UFDs and Artinian rings...
It's interesting that smoothness in AG basically corresponds to being a submersion in DG

Axiomatic characterization?
Functorial characterization?
Think about maps (functors?) valued on filtrations and other such things
Compute lots of examples of lengths of modules
What about codim?
Transferring our understanding of dim to other geometric settings
	Do things agree in the adic or other nonarchimedean (=ultrametric) settings?

Should Krull chains be ascending or descending?
What kinds of things are we allowed to put in the chain?
Note that infinite rings can have proper subrings which are isomorphic to them

Complement of closed is always open
Complement of open need not be closed
Rule of thumb: Any result solely involving commutative algebra transfers to our setting
When do we naturally get a qcqs morphism?
In the classical qc setting:
	Underlying set of scheme-theoretic image is the topological closure of the classical image
	Construction of the scheme-theoretic image commutes with restriction to open subschemes
Open embeddings for us need not be qc but they are luckily always flat
Affine local on source/target are sus

F = \O^r \oplus \O(-1)^s
\implies \chi(F) = r
\implies H^0(F) = r+(r+s)d for d \geq 0
This is a straightforward exercise using the explicit cohomology computation for Serre twists

From the perspective of qcoh sheaves as we have realized them, how do we see the difference between globally and locally principal?
	I would assume that the most obvious thing to write down corresponds to locally principal
Use rational sections to get maps to P^1 and then pull back convenient (typically affine) open cover of P^1
Local freeness of finitely presented quasicoherent sheaves can be checked modulo every maximal ideal
Support is not something that lives in the world of quasicoherent sheaves
	There should be something more "natural" to say here

X smooth projective curve over field k
F coherent sheaf on X
--> H^i(X,F)=0 for i>0 since we have a quasi-finite map to P^1

P^1 has cover by two affines and pulling back essentially gives us something that is affine (hence has no higher cohomology)

For more general topoi which are subcanonical (i.e., respresentable guys are sheafy), when does representability (or maybe just local representability) have a cohomological characterization?

Let X be a smooth projective k-scheme, B\in\Alg_k, F\in\Coh(X_B) flat over B. Then, \m\mapsto\chi(F_{B/\m}) is locally constant.

Often, "quasi(-)" means "open subscheme of (-) scheme."

Claim: X\to\Spec B quasi-projective and x\in X(B) \implies x is closed embedding.

Pf: By definition, X\to\Spec B is X\xto{open embedding}Y\xto{closed embedding}\P_B^n\to\Spec B

1. Reduce to case X=\P_B^n
2. Prove the result explicitly in this simple case (do the computation!)
	One way to go is to think about the diagonal embedding for \P_B^n and fit it into a fiber square involving x

The point is that the product of X with itself has a universal section given by the diagonal

Euler characteristic \chi is invariant under suitable pushforwards

A vector bundle F is of general type if for all d either H^0(F(d\infty)=0 or H^1(F(d\infty))=0.
	What is "general" about this notion?
