Being more ramified brings you closer to a char p formal power series ring
	You get "one place better" with each step

X/k has a lift to W_2(k) --> vanishing of some deformation theoretic obstruction

L\eta - decoulage (?) - torsion-free resolution
	Its role is, more or less, to eliminate I-torsion
	Prop 6.12 is a super useful result
	Canonical representatives of homotopy classes - related to de Rham-Witt complex and crystalline cohomology
	Most of this stuff known by Deligne before he even did Weil conjectures

Prismatic cohomology gives us the best way to see the cohomology theory that BMS I produces

Katz-Oda - Gauss-Manin connection
	Local systems <--> flat (integrable) connections
	Riemann-Hilbert correspondence
	Higher order pushforwards of local systems by smooth proper maps yield local systems (think Ehresmann's(?) thm)

A_inf with p inverted is like a curve, sort of 
Modify vector bundle over A_inf along its theta fiber

Kedlaya - all vectors bundles over A_inf same as all vector bundles over A_inf with maximal ideal removed

Purity
	Hartog gives you fully faithfullness for vector bundle categories
	On dim 2 Noetherian scheme, removing codim 2 thing also gives you essential surjectivity
		Regularity is necessary here
		This is unique to the dim 2 case -- i.e., we can't just work with codim 2 (or higher stuff) for schemes of higher dim
	What's going on with the fiber stuff? Some kind of exact sequence related to fiber modifications at a point...

Some of the story comes from the so-called Hodge-Tate filtration

The local story for the ramification bounds is closely tied to properties of Lubin-Tate formal groups
	Upper/lower ramification groups come from looking at filtrations linking together things like (Z/p^n)^{\times} (or (\O_K/\pi^n)^{\times} more generally)
