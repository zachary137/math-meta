Thm of Tate-Serre on equiv of categories for p-divisible groups and formal Lie groups
	Full faithfulness argument shows that we have a limit of Hopf algebras (need to think about coalg structure)

Need to check that completed(?) tensor product of two FPS rings is FPS ring
	Need the completion since tensor product of FPS rings is probably not FPS ring
	Can reduce to thinking over the residue field by (flat) complete Nakayama
	Key at the beginning is replacing (p^n)-torsion by kernel of Frob., which is more explicit

It's not true that the following categories are equivalent:
	p-divisible groups over Z_p
	p-divisible groups over F_p
What we do have is that the special fiber functor is fully faithful

We have equivalence of categories:
	connected p-divisible groups
	divisible formal Lie groups
Use this to lift group law in connected case
	How do we know we satisfy all of the axioms?
	Certainly there must be a lift by complicated deformation theory technology

For the special and general fiber stuff, the Noetherian hypothesis is absolutely essential
	Both theorems fail spectacularly without the Noetherian hypothesis
	\mu_{p^{\infty}} and Q_p/Z_p over Z_p^{\cycl} illustrate the difficulty

Scholze-Weinstein classify p-divisible groups over C_p

de Jong's theorem fails if we drop the discreteness of the valuation

Condition (2) ensures in some sense that we are n-truncated and not (n-1)-truncated

Grothendieck-Messing theory
	Describes deformations through nilpotent thickenings
	Needs the assumption that we have at least one deformation -- then we can describe all of them
	Grothendieck settled this issue with an annoying affine condition
	Theory of crystals

p-divisible groups also have something that behaves like de Rham cohomology, with the Lie algebra arising from this thing (this is the "crystal" which can be somewhat complicated)
Vector bundle comes with filtration analogous to Hodge filtration
Assuming S --> S' is a PD thickening, the miracle is that the vector bundle over S' only depends on the vector bundle over S
Reduces whole problem to doing linear algebra on the crystal, independent of choices of lift (assuming only that one exists)

Why should \alpha,\mu_p,\un{\Z/p} be a complete list over an algebraically closed field?
	Hint: Hilbert Thm 90
	Also, for Hilbert thm 90 stuff, what happens over a non-algebraically closed field? How exactly do we get non-isomorphic Dieudonne modules?
Q: Why is every elliptic curve over \ov{\F_p} either ordinary or supersingular?
	Hint: rule out the \'{e}tale case using the Weil pairing or something like that
Duality here is something worth thinking about
	What should the "natural" notion be (e.g., a pairing)?
	Concretely describe the dual
	Check compatibility of the dual
Describe the dual of \alpha_{p^n}
Check the construction of W_2^2
	Superscript 2 probably refers to kernel of Frob squared
	Subscript 2 probably refers to functor that takes k-alg R to the additive group (W_2(R),+)
Why are Cartier duality and Weil duality compatible for abelian varieties (in other words, why do they capture the same thing)?
I guess this depends on knowing how D is defined. How do we do that explicitly? Is there some semi-enlightening way to describe it?
In the case that Frob is an isomorphism we can descend from W(k) to Z_p
	This works in the etale case
	Related to deficiencies of Tate module

Isogeny category of abelian varieties
	Poincare complete reducibility
		Uses dual abelian variety and choice of polarization to construct a suitable complement
	Semisimplicity of endomorphism algebras over Q
	Isogeny variant V_{\l}(A) of the Tate module T_{\l}(A)
Lefschetz principle
	In char. 0, statements about algebraic varieties over a field can often be reduced to statements about the same sort of objects over an algebraically closed field (typically \C)
	Admits various precise formulations
Berthelot-Breen-Messing
	Gives proof of result of Mazur-Messing-Oda

The Honda system stuff is trying to lift Hodge filtrations
The conditions are enough to rule out p-torsion for M/L
	Is this enough to get torsion-free in general?
We want L to be a direct summand of L
Condition (2) is equivalent to F(L+pM)=pM

There are diametrically opposite cases where the image of Frob and the Hodge filtration are far apart
Are image of Frob and the Hodge filtration always complementary? No? Supersingular elliptic curves?

The Hodge filtration here is defined in analogy with other Hodge filtrations
Frob-invariant differential forms

Grothendieck-Messing theory applies only when the divided powers are nilpotent or connected
	For p>2 the nilpotent condition is automatic, but it does not hold when p=2
	When p=2 we can impose connectivity to get ourselves in the right boat

The discrepancy seems to be due to the BC CMI notes rather than Oh

Rigidity thm follows from Maximum Principle
	We have a scheme theoretic analogue for proper things
	Think about the relationship between P^1 and A^1
Getting the geometric point is a result of faithfully flat descent

Deformation functor takes local Artin algebras (with specified residue field) to groupoids
	Goal is basically to deform from "special" fiber
	If working over a perfect field in positive char. then Witt vectors are relevant

With the cotangent complex, extension classes arise from looking at shifts
	We want to control lifts along nilpotent thickenings
