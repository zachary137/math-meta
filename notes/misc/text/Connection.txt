The derived pushforward R^1 f_* (applied to a particular argument) is used to construct a locally constant sheaf 
whose fibers are naturally identified with cohomology groups of fibers of f (relative to the given argument)
In other words, derived pushforward is a useful tool for studying cohomology of families (which should encode important geometric information)

Observation: Trying to descend a global period map from the universal cover often runs into problems caused by monodromy

Flat/integrable connections have vanishing curvature
How is this linked to flatness using the descent picture?
Frobenius Integrability Thm says points in the fiber of a vector bundle equipped with flat connection can be locally lifted to get a flat local section
Results like the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence are surprising because they link purely topological information (encoded by local systems) to analytic data (encoded by flat connections, which track solutions to systems of ODEs)

Question: What do Newton and Hodge polygons have to do with all of this?

Universal property for divided power algebra over a module
	Note that, given a ring A and an ideal I, there is often more than one way to put a divided power structure on I

1. Crystalline site in general has no final object
	This is why we need to work harder and consider crystals
	Not a problem for perfectoid stuff
	Given a perfect F_p-algebra, passing to Witt vectors gives initial object in category of PD thickenings (of rings)
	Classical de Rham-Witt complex is not obviously linked to this stuff
	Saturated de Rham-Witt complex is much more easily (and obviously) linked to this stuff (c.f. BLM paper)

2. Exterior algebra functor is not additive functor on chain complexes
	Need to pass to simplicial stuff using Dold-Kan, compute exterior powers, and then translate back
	Up to a shift, exterior powers of chain complexes are computed by taking divided powers [I don't think this makes any sense...]
	Koszul duality pairing gives rise to relationship among symmetric, exterior, and divided powers
	Explains how divided powers naturally arise when deriving the de Rham complex
	Geometric and categorical perspectives on Tor amplitudes of smooth things (degree 0) and local complete intersections (degree [-1,0])

Two points above help explain why syntomic and quasi-syntomic things enter the picture when doing crystalline stuff
What does the geometry of prisms have to say about all of this?

Let's unravel what connections have to do with descent and such

Parallel transport perspective
	Geometrically, this should give us a way to relate elements of nearby fibers for some bundle
	In algebraic geometry we make sense of being "infinitesimally close" through various forms of nilpotence
		Genuine nilpotence
		Formal (limit of genuine nilpotence)
		Topological nilpotence (linked to formal perspective in many ways)
	Given a map f: X --> Y of geometric spaces (which we may simply take to be schemes or manifolds), we can consider nilpotent thickenings of the diagonal in X \times_Y X
		Universal square-zero thickening (in fact we have universal nilpotent thickenings of any desired finite degree of nilpotence) involving ideal of definition for the diagonal
		We get pairs of infinitesimally close elements by considering the fiber of each projection map
		Doing this in the affine case recovers purely algebraic notion of connection
		More generally we see that we need to specify an isomorphism between the pullbacks by each projection map
	Cocycle condition on projection pullbacks
		Parallel transport from fiber 1 to fiber 2 and then from fiber 2 to fiber 3 should be the same as parallel transport from fiber 1 to fiber 3
		Corresponds exactly to flatness of the connection (also called integrability, with the name *possibly* influenced by a different differential geometry result)
		Does this correspond to some object in an abelian category (or a closely related type of category) being flat?
	What if instead of nilpotent thickenings we consider PD thickenings?
		Z_p is exactly a PD thickening of F_p
		Want to look at embeddings (even lifts) of char. p schemes to char. 0 schemes, compatible with the F_p-to-Z_p picture
		Use PD envelopes to thicken things (a priori no canonical way to do this, however every choice is uniquely linked to every other choice by way of parallel transport)
	Problem: divided powers may not be preserved under naive pullback
		This problem is already apparent when looking at Z_2 (and seeing how the 2-adic valuations of elements vary)
		There are two ways to get around this, both corresponding to imposing topological nilpotence on the right thing
		One method recovers notion of topological (quasi-)nilpotent connection (can be written as power series in differential operators after choosing coordinates, at least in the smooth case)
		With some work we identify crystals with the appropriate class of connections
	Do D-modules provide any insight into this matter?

Grothendieck tells us that divided powers and PD thickenings are also natural to consider for the purpose of getting a good theory of Chern classes
	Allows us to set up suitable obstruction theory
