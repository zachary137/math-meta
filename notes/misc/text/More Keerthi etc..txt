Thm (Lazard): Module if flat iff filtered colimit of finite free modules.

Deligne - Hodge II (~ page 13) - full perspective on decolage - move the spectral sequence by one page
	Page 14 gives one perspective on what the pages of the spectral sequence are capturing

L\eta plays a role in the book of Berthelot-Ogus at the end
	Want to do this because of work of Kisin
	Mazur's Thm
	Interaction of Frobenius, Hodge filtration, and crystalline stuff

Theory of crystals: Roy --> Kisin
Geometrically recover Kisin's functor in the prismatic story

Thm of Ogus on crystalline cohomology - characterizing image of Frob

See Katz-Oda paper on Gauss-Manin connection

Thm (Bhatt-Scholze): Z_p-lattices in Galois representations of appropriate sort form category equivalent to category of prisms
	How do prisms relate to Breuil-Kisin-Fargues modules?

Annulus of radius 1/p in a proper thing (like the closed unit disc)
	Why does proper mean you can enlarge slightly?
	Valuative criterion!
Annulus of slightly larger radius restricting down
	Compact image (this means the image is finite mod p)
	Relative compactness

Cover P^1 by G_m's
Vertical specialization

Extending from Spa(K,K^{\circ}) to Spa(K,K^+)
	Points can have valuations of rank larger than 1

Proper --(Chow's Lemma)--> projective ----> P^n
	Gives finiteness of cohomology for proper schemes
	Is there a more conceptual proof?

Getting smaller annulus corresponds to taking a blowup
	Different formal models for the same rigid analytic space
	Z_p\ip{t} is a formal model for Q_p\ip{t}
	Blowup at the origin (which corresponds to special fiber F_p\ip{t})
	Proj Z_p[x,y]/(px-ty)
	Suggests Z_p\ip{t} is a surface (of course it literally has Krull dim 2)
	Different choices of R^+ yield different formal models (though this does not account for everything)
	Maybe look at this paper: http://achinger.impan.pl/rigid/blowups.pdf

In what sense does the local structure of etale maps relate to maps to A^1?
Why does A^1 have no nontrivial etale covers?

Explicitly compute tilts and Tate twists associated to:
	\Z_p[\zeta_{p^{\infty}}]_p^{\wedge}
	\Z_p[p^{1/p^{\infty}}]_p^{\wedge}
