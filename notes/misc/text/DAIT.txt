Sum of four squares generating function gives modular form on the upper half plane
	Arises from theta correspondence between SL_2 and SO(4)
	Kernel comes from theta function on GSp(8)

Stack of torsors for a fixed group -- locally this is what "nice" stacks look like (c.f. Artin stacks)

More "natural" definition/approach to numerical equivalence and other forms of (algebraic) equivalence

We define Pic^0 in terms of the functor-of-points by having vanishing Euler characteristic -- What exactly does this mean?
	Euler characteristic of fibers
	Conrad gives some characterization in terms of Euler characteristic (in his notes on abelian varieties) that might be helpful

Degree 0 line bundles are those with a certain symmetry
	Multiplicative line bundles (I think this is the right term)

Degree 0 line bundles are in some sense "very far" from being ample
	Ample ~ positive Chern class ~ positive definite pairing
	Deg 0 ~ vanishing Chern class ~ trivial pairing

Derived part of purity in flat cohomology

Artin-Schreier sheaf and Lang isogeny in context of pro-etale topology
Codim and eigenspaces of Adams (Adems?) operators

Closed immersions are not monomorphisms in the derived setting

Being open immersion and unramified are both truncated versions of a more general thing
	Ask Ken about this (apparently there is something in the algebraic geometry channel for the AT Discord)

Derived prismatic cohomology

Bhargav Bhatt gave a course on D-modules (handwritten notes by Shizhang Li)

We should have a theory of Chow groups valued in families of local systems
	These families *should* (conjecturally) arise from motives

Rank r positive definite lattices give rise to codim r cycle classes in the Chow group CH^r
Given an appropriately formed power series with coefficients given by cycle classes, we can ask if it arises as the Fourier expansion of a modular form
In the classical setting, singular matrices don't have a good moduli interpretation

Applications of l-adic perverse sheaves and the l-adic Fourier transform
	Brylinski-Radon transform and proof of the Hard Lefschetz Theorem
	Estimates for exponential sums (e.g., Kloosterman sums)
	Springer representations of Weyl groups of semisimple algebraic groups

Contructibility is a technical condition which eliminates pathologies
Working with so-called middle perversity significantly simplifies the picture
	We impose dim conditions on supports of various cohomology sheaves

How I should think about gerbes in classical stack theory vs. DAG?

Basics of swapping representations for theta correspondence
Basics of Siegel-Weil formula

What exactly is a Hecke correspondence and how is it related to Hecke operators?
	This should be connected to the Eichler-Shimura relation, though I'm not too familiar with that story...
What makes metaplectic stuff "natural" to consider?
	Double cover of symplectic group
	Weil representation, projective representation theory, Pontrjagin duality
What's up with cohomology sheaves in Lysenko's picture?
	This is needed to get the metaplectic gerbe
