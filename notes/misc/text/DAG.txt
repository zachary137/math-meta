Grothendieck-Segal conditions for simplicial set to be same as a nerve
"Derived category of schemes"

What does it mean to say that a nilpotent thickening is split?
We know that deformations should be classified by Ext^1 and obstructions should be classified by Ext^2
What does this have to do with connections?
Derivations should satisfy some kind of descent

Schemes sit somewhere between 0-Artin and 1-Artin stacks, being considerably more general than the former and considerably less so than the latter

Conditions we can put on a prestack:
	Compact generation
	Dualizability
	Rigidity

One nice consequence of our approach will be an intuitive description of G-equivariant sheaves over an arbitrary prestack

\leq 0: connective
\geq 0: coconnective
eventually connective = bounded above
eventually coconnective = bounded below

The Lurie tensor product of Mod_A and Mod_B should be Mod_{A\tensor B}

We cannot define \infty-categorical functors by specifying what they do on objects and morphisms, so we must make use of un/straightening or some other technique/process

Derived analytic geometry (should come in archimedean and non-archimedean flavors, potentially quite different from each other)

Morava K-theories are in some precise sense supposed to function as the points of the hypothetical Spec(S) (for S the sphere spectrum)

One of the miracles of "higher" K-theory is that the only real obstruction comes from K_0 itself!

What is the Ben-Zvi-Nadler approach to QCoh?

Just to nitpick, the "animation" of a category C, in the sense advocated by Clausen et. al., 
is not quite just taking P_Sigma(C).  Rather it's defined for "algebraic categories" C (in the sense of Lawvere).  
So for example you want to animate something like the category of sets or abelian groups, and get P_Sigma(Fin) or P_Sigma(FAb), 
respectively (finite sets and finite abelian groups).

I don't know whether it is considered arithmetic geometry, 
but the following seems to be a consequence of Pontryagin duality: 
any cofiltered diagram of finite abelian groups has trivial higher derived limits.

What's the basic idea behind Artin and Deligne-Mumford stacks?
How do we describe schemes in a purely functorial way?

Review Keerthi comments
	"Correct" (morally) definition of Dold-Kan map (essential surjectivity comes from idempotent completeness)
	Details for aspects of Koszul duality (symmetric, exterior, and divided power algebras; shifts and duals)
	Correct definition of K_0^Y(X)
	"Homotopy invariance" of G_0 with respect to A^1 (as described by Leon; I need more info on this...)
	Pseudo-coherent complexes (Is this at all related to Kiran's notion?)
	Recovering Serre's Tor intersection formula

Why is general deformation theory "nice?"
	Deformation to the normal cone
	Diagonal for smooth varieties is lci
Gillet-Soule approach over Z
	Use K-theory
	Alterations can be brought in to streamline things (and maybe provide conceptual insight?)

The name for "blowing up" comes from the geometric idea of "zooming in"

Blowups provide a universal way to turn subvarieties into Cartier divisors
	Cartier divisors
	Projective families
	Resolution of singularities
	Strict transform
	Total transform
	Exceptional divisor
	Deformation to the normal cone

Do the classic DAG example of an exceptional divisor with self-intersection -1
	DAG explains how we could get a negative number

Does DAG give us a better way to view the various forms of equivalence used in AG?

The intuitive idea is to introduce potentially missing "directions" that help account for the singularities of the underlying scheme
	We want to replace a troublesome point by something like the projectivized tangent cone at that point
	How can we see this from the functor-of-points?
