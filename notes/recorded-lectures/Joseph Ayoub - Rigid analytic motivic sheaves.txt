We can get category of rigid analytic spaces by taking category of formal schemes and formally inverting admissible blowups
	Yields so-called generic fiber approach of Raynaud
	Formal schemes here are required to be qcqs with finite type ideal of definition
	Admissible blowups are blowups of open finite type ideals
	Technically this only gives qcqs rigid analytic spaces -- next need to glue along open immersions

Raynaud's approach seems to yield a "detopologized" rigid analytic space, since we can approach formal schemes without using topology

Affinoid adic spaces Spa(A,A^+) are related to rigid analytic spaces by rigidifying Spf(A^+) [What does this even mean?]

How do we understand etale morphisms for rigid analytic spaces?
	One guess is to say that they arise from etale morphisms of formal scheme
	It's certainly true that the Raynaud generic fiber of an etale morphism of formal schemes is etale
	However, this is not everything -- etale should mean "ramified only along the special fiber"
	There is good notion of rigid-etale morphism that does what we want
	Also have good notion of smoothness

For rigid etale motives, need to replace affine line by the so-called Tate ball
	Get different flavors when comparing the Nisnevich and etale topologies
	Overconvergence plays some role here (analytic topology as well)

Six-functor formalism
	Involves a Thom space twist somewhere
	One of the key results is extended proper base change

Formal motives are related to ordinary motives via the "special fiber" functor
