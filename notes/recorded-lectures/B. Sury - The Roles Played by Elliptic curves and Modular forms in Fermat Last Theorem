Let E be a cubic curve over an algebraically closed field K satisfying a Weierstrass equation.
	If E is singular then it has exactly one singular point which is either a node or a cusp.
	The nonsingular points of E satisfy a group law.
		Node --> multiplicative group of K
		Cusp --> additive group of K

Suppose E is an elliptic curve defined over \Q.
	Choose a model over \Z which has minimal discriminant.
	We obtain reduced curves E_p over \F_p for each rational prime p.
	Good reduction: E_p is nonsingular
	Semistable/multiplicative reduction: E_p has a node
	Unstable/additive reduction: E_p has a cusp

What follows can be viewed in a much more intrinsically geometric manner, but let's not worry about that for now.

A meromorphic function f on \H is modular of weight k for \Gamma:=\SL_2(\Z) if:
	f(\gamma z)=(cz+d)^kf(z) for every \gamma={{a,b},{c,d}} in \Gamma;
	Fourier expansion of f in variable q:=\exp(2\pi iz) looks like f(z)=\sum_{n\geq n_0}c(n)q^n for some integer n_0.
A modular function f of weight k is a modular form if:
	f is holomorphic;
	n_0=0 (in which case f(\infty):=c(0)).
A cusp form is a modular form with c(0)=0.

Example: Consider the standard Eisenstein series
G_{2k}(z):=\sum_{(m,n)\neq(0,0)}(m+nz)^{-2k}.
This is a modular form of weight 2k.

M_k:={space of modular forms of weight 2k}
M_{k,0}:={spacce of cusp forms of weight 2k}
These are naturally \C-vector spaces with M_k in fact a graded \C-algebra.

Facts:
	Every modular form is a homogeneous polynomial in G_4 and G_6 -- i.e., M\iso\C[G_4,G_6].
	M_k={0} for k<0.
	\dim_{\C}M_k=[k/6] for k\geq0 and 1 mod 6.
	\dim_{\C}M_k=[k/6]+1 for k\geq0 and not 1 mod 6.

Consider the extended upper half-plane \H^*:=\H\cup\P^1(\Q).
Our interest is in the Riemann surface \H^*/\Gamma, and in the role played by various congruence subgroups of \Gamma.
We can extend the notions of modular function, modular form, and cusp form to make sense for, e.g., working with \Gamma_0(N).

Fact: There is an isomorphism of vector spaces between
	{weight 2 cusp forms for \Gamma_0(N)} and
	{holomorphic 1-forms on \H^*/\Gamma_0(N)}.

Corollary: N=2 \implies genus=0 \implies there are no nonzero weight 2 modular forms for \Gamma_0(2).

To a cusp form f Shimura associates an elliptic curve E_f by considering appropriate integrals.
	Consider the set L_f of points in \C given by \int_{z_0}^{gz_0} f(z)dz for g in \Gamma_0(N).
	L_f is a lattice independent of the choice of z_0 and the torus \C/L_f is defined over \Q.
	p+1-|E_f(\F_p)|=a_p the pth Fourier coefficient of f.

The moduli interpretation of \H/\Gamma_0(N) is that it parametrizes (isomorphism classes of) tori with a cyclic subgroup of order N.

Statement of Taniyama-Shimura-Weil - look this up later when relevant.

Theorem (Deligne-Serre): There exists a unique (up to unique isomorphism) continuous semisimple Galois representation \rho: \Gal(\Q)\to\GL_2(k_M) such that:
	\det\rho = \lth cyclotomic character for \l the characteristic of k_M (the residue field of the Hecke algebra T at some maximal ideal M)
		[Should this be \rho(\Fr_p)?]
	\rho is unramified away from N
	\tr\rho(\Fr_p) = T_p mod N away from N

Note: Uniqueness comes from:
	2 dimensional representation is determined by its trace and determinant
	Chebotarev denisty theorem
