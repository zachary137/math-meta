We want a theory of "solid modules" (condensed abelian groups + extra conditions) over "analytic rings" (condensed rings + extra data)

Category of usual coherent sheaves (discrete modules) over a ring does NOT have good notions of f_! and f^!
Can embed this fully faithfully into category of solid modules over a ring
	DOES have good notions of f_! and f^!

Moral: The construction of f^! is closely tied to Pontrjagin duals
	Taken from theory of harmonic analysis over locally compact Hausdorff groups
	Interchanges discrete abelian groups and compact abelian groups

Problem: A good notion of shtuka over Z does not exist as of the date of this talk (Spring 2021)

Bambozzi-Ben-Bassat-Kremnizer
	"Derived bornological geometry"
	Goal is to construct, in some sense, Fargues-Fontaine curve over F_1
Ginzburg did some char. 0 work on geometric Satake following ideas of Drinfeld
Smith-Treumann theory
	Can maybe mix with the condensed theory but this is currently unknown
