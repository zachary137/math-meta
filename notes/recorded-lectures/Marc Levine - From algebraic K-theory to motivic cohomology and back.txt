Attempts at getting Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for Beilinson's conjectures:
	Bloch-Lichtenbaum (by hand for fields, using "moving by blowing up")
	Friedlander-Suslin (extending BL)
	Grayson (quite different)
	Voevodsky (coordinate-free, using the motivic stable homotopy category)

Voevodsky gives motivic version of the Postnikov tower used in stable homotopy theory
	This more classical stable gadget is the sense in which Beilinson wanted an Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
	Voevodsky defines what are often referred to as homotopy motives for K-theory 
	Elegant connection with topological K-theory given (in its modern form) by work of Hopkins-Morel (sketch) and Hoyois (details) (using motivic Steenrod algebra)
	Landweber exact formal group laws let us get K-theory from cobordism theory (works in the algebraic and topological (or at least complex) settings)
	Important computation of Spitzwech
