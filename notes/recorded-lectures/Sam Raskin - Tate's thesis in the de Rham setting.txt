Slogan: sifted colimits are generated by filtered colimits and geometric realizations
	\infty-category admits sifted colimits iff it admits filtered colimits and geometric realizations of simplicial objects
	functor commutes with sifted colimits iff it is commutes with filtered colimits and geometric realizations
Slogan: all colimits are generated by sifted colimits and coproducts

Warmup: D(G_m) \simeq QCoh(A^1/Z)
	LHS is category of D-modules on G_m
	RHS parametrizes translation-equivariant sheaves on A^1
	Reminiscent of a Mellin transform

Theorem (Beilinson-Deligne): D(K^{\times}) \simeq QCoh(LS_{G_m})
	K here is the field k((t)) (for k=C)
	LS_{G_m} parametrizes one-dimensional local systems over K

RHS's of both are connected via the map A^1/Z \to LS_{G_m}
	\lambda \mapsto \nabla = d-(\lambda/t)dt
	We are thinking about algebraic differential equations
	The naive topological perspective, while helpful, can lead us astray (e.g., some algebraically nontrivial processes are topologically trivial)
	Some issues persist even if we replace "topological" by "holomorphic" (or some other kind of analytic condition)
