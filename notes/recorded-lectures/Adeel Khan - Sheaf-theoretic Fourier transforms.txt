Note: There might be separate "Sato" and "Saito" in this story...

MacPherson (conjecture of Deligne and Grothendieck)
	X char. 0
	Cons(X) = {constructible functions f: X\to\Z}
		This means we have some stratification with f locally constant on each stratum
	Natural map c_X: Cons(X)\to CH_*(X) compatible with proper pushforward
	X smooth \implies c_X(1) is total Chern class of T_X (tangent sheaf) capped with fundamental class [X]
	Can be seen as analogue of Gauss-Bonnet in the singular case

Microlocal description of c_X (Sabbah, Ginzburg, Kashiwara, Sato)
	"Microlocal" here indicates that are we working with things in terms of the geometry of cotangent bundles
1. Cons(X) --> {Lagrangian cycles in T^*M supported on X}
	This is assuming we can find an embedding X\inj M with M smooth (often possible)
	This map is some version of microlocalization
	RHS can be viewed as symplectic analogue of Chow group
2. Intersection with zero section 0: M\inj T^*M

Sheaf-theoretic interpretation (Sato (1969), Kashiwara-Schapira)
	D_c(X) = {constructible sheaves on X}
	There is a rank isomorphism rk: K_0(D_c(X))\to Cons(X)
	So, we can write down cc_X: K_0(D_c(X))\to CH_*(X) giving us characteristic cycles
	Constructing this map is a bit subtle

Sato: define a "microlocalization of sheaves" \mu_X: D(X)\to D^{\G_m}(T^*X)
	Specialization to the tangent bundle
	Fourier-Sato transform FS: D^{\G_m}(TX)\to D^{\G_m}(T^*X)
		One checks that this preserves constructible objects
		Actually works for any vector bundle and its dual

Singular support SS(F) of constructible sheaf F
	Contained in T^*X
	Lets us define characteristic class CC(F) living in CH_*(T^*X) supported on SS(F)
	From this we can build some kind of characteristic cycle
	Somehow lets us pass from sheaves to functions

Deligne gives analogy between:
	irregular singularities (of a D-module or PDE, in the analytic setting)
	wild ramification (of an l-adic sheaf, in the pos. char. algebraic setting)
	analogy can't be super simple because of things like Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich (GOS) formula which tells you that MacPherson's result breaks down
	Beilinson and Sato have succeeded in getting higher dimensional analogues of GOS formula, allowing us to better understand things like proper pushforward
	Warning: We don't (yet, at least) have microlocalization in the l-adic setting!

Cisinski's program:
	1. Do Beilinson and Sato stuff in motivic setting
	2. Do microlocalization for motivic sheaves

Need to come back to this one at some point...
