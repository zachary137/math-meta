Fix an integer N\geq1.
To this we may associate the congruence subgroups \Gamma_0(N) and \Gamma_1(N) of \SL_2(\Z) consisting respectively of matrices which are upper-triangular and unipotent modulo N.
Given an integer k\geq2, let S_k(\Gamma_1(N),\C) be the space of cusp forms of weight k.
  All that matters for now is that these cusp forms are particular instances of modular forms, which can be viewed as sections of appropriate line bundles.
Acting on these are three types of operators, which are characterized by their Fourier expansions.
  Hecke operators T_{\l} for \l not dividing N
  Atkin-Lehner operators U_{\l} for \l dividing N
  diamond operators <d>
Let f(z) be a normalized Hecke eigen-cusp form.
This has a Fourier expansion \sum_{n\geq1}a_n\exp(2\pi inz) with the coefficients a_n all algebraic integers generating a number field F.
Let p be a rational prime and \p its lift to \O_F, from which we obtain the \p-adic completion \O.
Using etale cohomology, Deligne associates a continuous Galois representation \rho_{f,\p}: \Gal(\ov{Q}/Q)\to\GL_2(\O).
For \l not dividing Np, this representation is unramified and \rho_{f,\p}(\sigma_{\l}) has characteristic polynomial x^2-a_{\l}x+\l^{k-1}\psi(\l).
  \sigma_{\l} is a lift of the Frobenius from \Gal(\ov{\F_p}/\F_p) to G_{\l}:=\Gal(\ov{\Q_{\l}}/\Q_{\l}).
  \psi is the level-type character, whatever that means.
