Fix an integer N\geq1.
To this we may associate the congruence subgroups \Gamma_0(N) and \Gamma_1(N) of \SL_2(\Z) consisting respectively of matrices which are upper-triangular and unipotent modulo N.
Given an integer k\geq2, let S_k(\Gamma_1(N),\C) be the space of cuspforms of weight k.
  All that matters for now is that these cuspforms are particular instances of modular forms, which can be viewed as sections of appropriate line bundles.
Acting on these are three types of operators, which are characterized by their Fourier expansions.
  Hecke operators T_{\l} for \l not dividing N
  Atkin-Lehner operators U_{\l} for \l dividing N
  diamond operators <d>
Let f(z) be a normalized Hecke eigencuspform.
This has a Fourier expansion \sum_{n\geq1}a_n\exp(2\pi inz) with the coefficients a_n all algebraic integers generating a number field F.
Let p be a rational prime and \p its lift to \O_F, from which we obtain the \p-adic completion \O.
Using etale cohomology, Deligne associates a continuous Galois representation \rho_{f,\p}: \Gal(\ov{Q}/Q)\to\GL_2(\O).
For \l not dividing Np, this representation is unramified and \rho_{f,\p}(\sigma_{\l}) has characteristic polynomial x^2-a_{\l}x+\l^{k-1}\psi(\l).
  \sigma_{\l} is a lift of the Frobenius from \Gal(\ov{\F_p}/\F_p) to G_{\l}:=\Gal(\ov{\Q_{\l}}/\Q_{\l}).
  \psi is the level-type character, whatever that means.
  This provides the direct link on how we recover the Fourier coefficients as the "trace of Frobenius."
Simply put, an elliptic curve E/\Q is modular if the Galois representation afforded by its Tate module is equivalent to \rho_{f,p} for p some rational prime and f a Hecke eigencuspform of weight 2 on \Gamma_0(N) (with rational coefficients).
  Do we want \p here and not just p?
  Remarkably, if the above holds for some p then it holds for all p (this doesn't seem at all clear to me, aside from vaguely appealing to compatibility).

Original Taylor-Wiles method is used to show that semistable elliptic curves are modular.
Let J_1(N) be the Jacobian of the modular curve X_1(N), which has the structure of an abelian variety over \Q.
Its Tate module (associated to some rational prime p) is a free \Z_p-module of rank 2n for n the dimension of J_1(N).
Via a very non-canonical process (which also destroys topological information) we can view this Tate module as a module over the free \Z_p-algebra \T_N generated by the endomorphisms of S_2(\Gamma_1(N)).
A Hecke eigenform f of weight 2 induces a homomorphism \phi_f: \T_N\to\O with relation T(f) = \phi_f(T)f for T\in\T_N.
Let \m be the maximal ideal generated by \ker(\phi_f) and choose a uniformizer \varpi of \O.
As before Deligne constructs for us a Galois representation \rho_{f,\p}: \Gal(\ov{\Q}/\Q)\to\GL_2(\O) which we then want to analyze.

Deformations (of Galois representations) - technique introduced by Mazur
Let K be a finite extension of Q_p with valuation ring \O, residue field \F, and uniformizer \varpi.
Going moduli \varpi, we obtain from any Galois representation living over \O a residual Galois representation living over \F.
The upstairs guy may be viewed as a deformation of the residual representation, so the name of the game is lifting.
We are interested in rings R that are complete local Noetherian \O-algebras with residue field \F, which we call coefficient rings and comprise a category CLN_{\O}.
Such rings all have the form \O[[X_1,\ldots,X_m]]/(g_1,\ldots,g_k).
We formulate our deformation lifting problem with R upstairs and \F downstairs.
For simplicity, unless otherwise stated we let G denote the absolute Galois group of \Q.
We say two Galois representations G\to\GL_2(R) are strictly equivalent if they are conjugate by a matrix in ker(\GL_2(R)\to\GL_2(\F)) (certainly the action of such matrices should be trivial).
We take a deformation to be a strict equivalence class of lifts.
Say now we want to study the deformations of some \ov{\rho}.
Let S be a finite set of rational primes away from which \ov{\rho} is unramified.
Let G_S be the maximal quotient of G unramified away from S.
To S we may associate a universal deformation which is unramified away from S.

We can make the deformation problem local by instead considering lifts of G_{\l}\to\GL_2(\F).
We have a (naive) deformation functor Def_{\l}: CLN_{\O}\to\Set which simply picks out the set of deformations.
A deformation condition is a subfunctor C_{\l} of Def_{\l} satisfying certain technical conditions which, among other things, make it representable.
  This allows us to pick out lifts with a specified property.
A deformation type is the data of: 
  a set \Sigma of primes away from which \ov{\rho} is unramified
  a deformation condition C_{\l} imposed at each \l\in\Sigma
Let E/\Q be a semistable elliptic curve.
The 3-5 switch:
  Case 1: \ov{\rho}_{E,3} is absolutely irreducible (i.e., irreducible upon base change to the algebraic closure) and hence modular by Langlands-Tunnell
  Case 2: \ov{\rho}_{E,3} is not absolutely irreducible and thus \ov{\rho}_{E,5} is absolutely irreducible (this uses semistability)
  Why does this work?
Let N_0 be the prime-to-p part of the Artin conductor of \ov{\rho}.
  This should be viewed as the minimal level we can get for a lift of \ov{\rho}.
Let \T_0 be the Hecke algebra at minimal level N_0 localized at an appropriate maximal ideal (associated to \ov{\rho}).
  We did this earlier...
  This \T_0 is a candidate for coefficient ring.
Letting S be the set of primes dividing N_0p, we have a minimal deformation type \D_{min}:=(S,{C_{\l}}_{\l\in S}).
  These deformation conditions come in three flavors: Steinberg, Selmer, flat.
  The Selmer condition is particularly nice from a representation-theoretic perspective.
Let R_0 be the universal deformation ring associated to \D_{min}, which exists (and is unique up to unique isomorphism) by representability.
Using the Jacobian, we obtain a Galois representation \rho': G\to\GL_2(\T_0) which turns out to fit the type \D_{min}.
By universality we obtain a map \phi_0: R_0\to\T_0.

Goal: \phi_0 is an isomorphism (and, in fact, we have isomorphisms "at all levels")
Why do we care?
  Representations of elliptic curves in our setting correspond with maps R\to\Z_p.
  So, we are led to study maps \T\to\Z_p.
  Fact: Any homomorphism \T\to\Z_p arises from a Hecke eigenform f, with a Hecke operator T being sent to \phi_f(T).
  Hence, an "R=\T" result is the key to establishing modularity.
We say a rational prime q is Taylor-Wiles if 
  q is not in S;
  q is 1 mod p; and
  \ov{\rho}(\sigma_q) is semisimple with distinct eigenvalues.
Let Q={q_1,\ldots,q_r} be a set of Taylor-Wiles primes.
Define a deformation type \D_Q at S\cup Q by allowing ramification at Q.
  This extends \D_{min}, but I'm not sure what the extended deformation conditions are.
  We get an associated deformation ring R_Q and a natural homomorphism R_Q\to R_0.
Let \Delta_q be the p-primary part (\Z/q)^{\times} and \Delta_Q be the product of \Delta_q for q\in Q.
  I'm sure it will become apparent why we want to consider this but I would appreciate some initial motivation.
R_Q is naturally an \O[\Delta_Q]-algebra and we have R_Q/\a_QR_Q \iso R_0 for \a_Q the augmentation ideal.
Similar statements hold with every instance of R replaced by \T.
We have natural maps \phi_Q: R_Q\to\T_Q which we want to show are isomorphisms by passing to an appropriate inverse limit.

Patching - the basic idea here is simple but there is still a lot of content (needs input from Galois/etale cohomology)
Statement: There exists an integer r\geq1 such that, for every n\geq1, there is a set Q_n of r Taylor-Wiles primes such that every q\in Q_n is 1 mod p^n.
  We get from this a deformation ring R_n=R_{Q_n} and Hecke algebra \T_n=\T_{Q_n}.
  In fact, given the pair (R_n,\T_n), we can compatibly choose the pair (R_{n+1},\T_{n+1}).
  Letting \Delta_n=\Delta_{Q_n}, note that R_n and T_n are algebras over \O[\Delta_n]\iso\O[S_1,\ldots,S_r]/((1+S_1)^{p^n}-1,\ldots,(1+S_r)^{p^n}-1).
  Taking the inverse limit over n gives \O_{\infty}\iso\O[[S_1,\ldots,S_r]].
