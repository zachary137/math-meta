Fix an integer N\geq1.
To this we may associate the congruence subgroups \Gamma_0(N) and \Gamma_1(N) of \SL_2(\Z) consisting respectively of matrices which are upper-triangular and unipotent modulo N.
Given an integer k\geq2, let S_k(\Gamma_1(N),\C) be the space of cuspforms of weight k.
  All that matters for now is that these cuspforms are particular instances of modular forms, which can be viewed as sections of appropriate line bundles.
Acting on these are three types of operators, which are characterized by their Fourier expansions.
  Hecke operators T_{\l} for \l not dividing N
  Atkin-Lehner operators U_{\l} for \l dividing N
  diamond operators <d>
Let f(z) be a normalized Hecke eigencuspform.
This has a Fourier expansion \sum_{n\geq1}a_n\exp(2\pi inz) with the coefficients a_n all algebraic integers generating a number field F.
Let p be a rational prime and \p its lift to \O_F, from which we obtain the \p-adic completion \O.
Using etale cohomology, Deligne associates a continuous Galois representation \rho_{f,\p}: \Gal(\ov{Q}/Q)\to\GL_2(\O).
For \l not dividing Np, this representation is unramified and \rho_{f,\p}(\sigma_{\l}) has characteristic polynomial x^2-a_{\l}x+\l^{k-1}\psi(\l).
  \sigma_{\l} is a lift of the Frobenius from \Gal(\ov{\F_p}/\F_p) to G_{\l}:=\Gal(\ov{\Q_{\l}}/\Q_{\l}).
  \psi is the level-type character, whatever that means.
  This provides the direct link on how we recover the Fourier coefficients as the "trace of Frobenius."
Simply put, an elliptic curve E/\Q is modular if the Galois representation afforded by its Tate module is equivalent to \rho_{f,p} for p some rational prime and f a Hecke eigencuspform of weight 2 on \Gamma_0(N) (with rational coefficients).
  Do we want \p here and not just p?
  Remarkably, if the above holds for some p then it holds for all p (this doesn't seem at all clear to me, aside from vaguely appealing to compatibility).

Original Taylor-Wiles method is used to show that semistable elliptic curves are modular.
Let J_1(N) be the Jacobian of the modular curve X_1(N), which has the structure of an abelian variety over \Q.
Its Tate module (associated to some rational prime p) is a free \Z_p-module of rank 2n for n the dimension of J_1(N).
Via a very non-canonical process (which also destroys topological information) we can view this Tate module as a module over the free \Z_p-algebra \T_N generated by the endomorphisms of S_2(\Gamma_1(N)).
A Hecke eigenform f of weight 2 induces a homomorphism \phi_f: \T_N\to\O with relation T(f) = \phi_f(T)f for T\in\T_N.
Let \m be the maximal ideal generated by \ker(\phi_f) and choose a uniformizer \varpi of \O.
As before Deligne constructs for us a Galois representation \rho_{f,\p}: \Gal(\ov{\Q}/\Q)\to\GL_2(\O) which we then want to analyze.
