Projectivity is not a local property

Part of the subtlety for virtual Cartier divisors is that we want Cartesian diagrams once we pass to underlying classical schemes (I think...)

What is geometric interpretation of taking nonnegative part of the graded algebra?

R_{Z/X} is the nonnegative part of R_{Z/X}^{ext}

Derived blowup Bl_Z X is Proj of R_{Z/X}

Derived Rees algebra does not behave quite like the classical Rees algebra

What is the geometry of the derived Proj construction?
	What about the spectral analogue?
	Is this related to pseudo-coherence?

Jeroen gives definition of normal cone as pullback of D_{Z/X}
	Can show that this is total space of a vector bundle, though should beware of non-connectivity
	Why is the pullback stacky with the right properties?
