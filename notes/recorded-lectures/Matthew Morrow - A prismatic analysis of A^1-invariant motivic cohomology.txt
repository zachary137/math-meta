Let A be an F_p-algebra
	This has dlog forms Omega_{A/F_p}^j generated by df_1/f_1\wedge\cdots\wedge df_j/f_j for f_i a unit in A
	If A is regular local then the dlog 1-forms are just A^{\times}/(A^{\times})^p
	We think of this as some kind of Tate twist of G_m/p
Studied in the '80s by Illusie (because crystalline cohomology) and Milne (because motivic stuff and special values of zeta functions)
	Useful for studying Zariski/etale cohomology of smooth varieties

For non-smooth things we should look at cdh cohomology
	Introduced by Voevodsky in his motivic work
	Cdh topology (at least on qcqs schemes, of any characteristic) is generated by Nisnevich topology together with covers coming from abstract blowups
	Any (probably quasi-excellent) X is locally regular in the cdh topology (at least if you believe in resolution of singularities)

Idea: R\Gamma_{cdh}(X,\Omega_{log}^j) is ad hoc (yet good) guess for mod p motivic cohomology

Thm: Cdh cohomology is A^1-invariant for qcqs F_p-schemes
	We will avoid resolution of singularities as well as any transfer technology
	We will exploit what we have learned about mod p cohomology, for things like prismatic cohomology, arc topology, etc.

What I want to know: modern understanding of derived de Rham cohomology

Moving for now to the "classical" point of view, we want to work with K-theory and motivic cohomology in the non-regular case
	Problem: K-theory is not generally A^1-invariant!
	Approach #1 (Weibel): we can replace K(X) by KH(X) which is minimally A^1-invariant, using purely formal methods
	Approach #2 (Hassemeyer, Cisinski, Kerz-Strunk-Tamme): KH(-) is the cdh sheafification of K(-)
	Amazingly, both methods give us the same thing!

Result: We have A^1-invariance assuming we are over a field or the ring of integers of a perfectoid field
	Hypotheses arise because we need to perform cdh-local argument using certain rank-1 valuation rings
	Main tool here is cdharc toplogy, which we can control using prismatic methods
