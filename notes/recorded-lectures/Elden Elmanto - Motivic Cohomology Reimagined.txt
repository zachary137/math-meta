Goal: Define a good theory of motivic cohomology for singular schemes

Theorem (Grothendieck): 
Let X be a quasiprojective smooth scheme over a field.
Then, K_0(X)_Q = \bigoplus_{i=0}^{dim X} CH^i(X)_Q. [rational statement]

Some History
1968: Bass makes sense of negative K-groups
1990: Thomason associates Bass K-groups K^B(X) to X quasiprojective which are "nice"
	Form Nisnevich sheaf of spectra
	Projective bundle formula
	A^1-invariance for regular Noetherian schemes (with K-groups vanishing in negative degrees)
2001: Weibel gives an interesting interpretation of K_{-2}(X) in certain circumstances
	Let X be a normal surface over a field 
	K_{\leq -3}(X) = 0
	K_{-2}(X) = Z^{\rho} for \rho the # of loops in the exceptional divisor for any resolution of singularities for X
Weibel also conjectures that K_{-dim(X)}(X) = 0 for X Noetherian and finite dimensional
2018: Kerz, Strunk, and Tamme prove Weibel's conjecture


1986: Bloch introduces higher Chow groups
1987: Notes on motivic cohomology (Beilinson-MacPherson-Schechtman, the "first" BMS)
	"Imagine a world where KU^*(X) is defined (for X a topological space) but not H^*(X)."
	Mused that, for X smooth quasiprojective over a field, K(X) should carry some descending filtration with Atiyah-Hirzebruch-style spectral sequence relating K-theory to cohomology of some twists (generalization of Tate twists)
	Chow line - computed by Chow groups using Riemann-Roch
	Milnor line - computed by Milnor K-theory
	Some precise vanishing region (support condition)
	Very closely connected to so-called Beilinson's conjectures

2019: Bachmann-Elmanto (close with Morrow) define Z(j)^{mot} which has many nice properties and agrees with many other constructions
	NOT A^1-invariant
	Nisnevich sheaf but not a cdh sheaf (there is a version with a cdh sheaf but we have to replace K-theory by motivic K-theory)
	Char. 0 theory here is closely related to THH and other such things a la BMS II (we are working in the equichar. case to avoid these kinds of mixed char. phenomena)
