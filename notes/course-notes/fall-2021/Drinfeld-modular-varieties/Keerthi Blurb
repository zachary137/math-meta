I will be teaching a class out of Gerard Laumon's book, 'Cohomology of Drinfeld Modular varieties I'. 

Here's why: 
Number theory is primarily interested in understanding the behavior of prime numbers, and of late, in a certain Langlandsy corner, 
this has meant studying the interplay between representation theory and the symmetries of the zeros of rational polynomials (i.e. Galois theory).

This turns out to be very hard. 
Fortunately, many of the questions posed about the integers can also be transposed to the world of polynomials over finite fields 
(they're both PIDs, for example), where we can bring to bear the full power of algebro-geometric and topological methods. 
This still doesn't make things very easy, but, on the other hand, 
it gives us tools to construct the geometric objects that reify the Langlandsy interplay I mentioned above.

Drinfeld modular varieties are an example of such objects: 
they allow us to relate representations of the general linear group over the ring of rational functions over finite fields 
(a 'fake number theory' replacement fo the group of invertible matrices over Q) with the theory of finite covers of the projective line (over finite fields). 
This kind of geometric object simply doesn't exist (yet) in the world of 'real' number theory*

Our goal for this course is to understand what Drinfeld modular varieties are, following largely the exposition of Laumon, 
with details and background filled in as necessary. 

While it will be useful to have encountered some algebraic geometry/algebraic topology, 
the class should be accessible to anyone who's taken the first year graduate algebra sequence (or equivalent). 

There will be biweekly homework exercises, and the class will follow a hybrid model with live streaming over Zoom.
