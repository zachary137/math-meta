My Topics in Algebra and Number Theory (MATH8845) will be an Introduction to Shimura Varieties. 

The ides is to cover the first few expository papers in the "Shimura Varieties" volume edited by Haines and Harris. 
The emphasis will be on the theory of integral models, especially for Shimura varieties associated to unitary groups. 

There are no official prerequisites, but I will assume that anyone taking the course is already familiar with the basics of schemes 
(at the level of Hartshorne) and abelian varieties.  
Although the course will mostly consist of lectures delivered by me, 
anyone registered for the course will be expected to give at least one lecture on a topic of their choosing.
