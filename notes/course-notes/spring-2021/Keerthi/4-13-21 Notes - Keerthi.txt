Note: This one is rough, so sorry about that.

Annulus of radius 1/p in a proper thing (like the closed unit disc)
	Why does proper mean you can enlarge slightly?
	Valuative criterion!
Annulus of slightly larger radius restricting down
	Compact image (this means the image is finite mod p)
	Relative compactness

Cover P^1 by G_m's
Vertical specialization

Extending from Spa(K,K^{\circ}) to Spa(K,K^+)
	Points can have valuations of rank larger than 1

Proper --(Chow's Lemma)--> projective ----> P^n
	Gives finiteness of cohomology for proper schemes
	Is there a more conceptual proof?

Getting smaller annulus corresponds to taking a blowup
	Different formal models for the same rigid analytic space
	Z_p\ip{t} is a formal model for Q_p\ip{t}
	Blowup at the origin (which corresponds to special fiber F_p\ip{t})
	Proj Z_p[x,y]/(px-ty)
	Suggests Z_p\ip{t} is a surface (of course it literally has Krull dim 2)
	Different choices of R^+ yield different formal models (though this does not account for everything)
	Maybe look at this paper: http://achinger.impan.pl/rigid/blowups.pdf

In what sense does the local structure of etale maps relate to maps to A^1?
Why does A^1 have no nontrivial etale covers?

Explicitly compute tilts and Tate twists associated to:
	\Z_p[\zeta_{p^{\infty}}]_p^{\wedge}
