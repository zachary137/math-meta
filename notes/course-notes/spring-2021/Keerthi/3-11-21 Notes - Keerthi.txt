Cokernel of injective ghost map killed by power of p implies W_r(\O) is isomorphic to product of copies of K hence coherent

To deduce coherence of W_r(\O):
	\O is coherent
	\O satisfies Artin-Rees property with respect to p
	Something or another is an NZD...
	Ideal becomes finitely generated when you invert p is itself finitely generated if p is NZD

	Zachary is speaking
	Let's talk about L\eta!
