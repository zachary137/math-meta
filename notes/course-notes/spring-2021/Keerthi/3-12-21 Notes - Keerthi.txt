To review:
	Bounded derived categories
		Homotopy categories (do chain homotopy the "right" way)
		F-injective subcategories
	General derived categories
		Triangulated categories
		Model categories (particularly built with homotopic applications in mind)
		dg categories (particularly built with geometric applications in mind)
		Stable \infty-categories
	Topoi
		Grothendieck's yoga
	Specifics for derived categories of modules over topoi
		K-flat (and strongly K-flat) complexes
		Convenient resolutions on the homotopy category
	
	(Naive) mapping cone
	Homotopy (co-)kernels
	Truncation
	Totalization
