Almost Purity Thm
	We'd like to do Galois descent
		We can do faithfully flat descent, but this won't be the same if things aren't finite etale
		Gluing data corresponds to Galois conjugation
	Perfectoid things are almost etale (perfectoid over perfectoid implies almost etale)
		Faithfully flat descent = almost Galois descent (so decalage will put us in business)
	
R_{\infty} is a local pro-etale cover of R
We can compute etale cohomology in the pro-etale topology using the Cech complex for R_{\infty}
	This computes Galois cohomology since R_{\infty} is Galois once you invert p
	In a nutshell, R_{\infty} is almost acyclic

It's a general result that we compute sheaf cohomology by taking limits over all possible Cech covers
	In the quasiseparated case intersections of affines are affines (which are acyclic) and we don't need to take a limit

Computing R\nu_* comes down to working with Cech complex with respect to Spf applied to R_{\infty}, R_{\infty}\tensor R_{\infty}, etc.
