Sum of four squares generating function gives modular form on the upper half plane
	Arises from theta correspondence between SL_2 and SO(4)
	Kernel comes from theta function on GSp(8)

Theta correspondence gives a way to relate functions on one group to functions on another group

Kudla, Gross-Zagier
	Geometric version of this
	Get correspondence between arithmo-geometric invariants and L-functions
	Connections to geometry of Q-varieties
	Interesting work of Yun-Zhang taking place over function fields
	How can we port this over to characteristic 0?
	We have some tools to do stuff at least locally at p -- local characteristic 0
