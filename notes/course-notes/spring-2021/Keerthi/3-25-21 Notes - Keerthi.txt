This business with the map L\eta_IC \to C is a little subtle
	Should help with crystalline computations later on
Remember that D^{\geq0}(\O_T) has a boundedness condition on cohomology and not complexes themselves (the latter condition is not stable under qis)
Nonetheless we CAN pass to computations with truncated complexes in certain cases
For the valuation ring case, we can generalize things a bit by doing calculations with colon ideals
	What happens if we are NOT working with a valuation ring?
	What is the relationship to Koczul resolutions?
Derived objects are built up (canonically) from their cohomology together with some Ext gluing relations
	Things become nice if we have conditions on projective dim of underlying rings and modules
If we choose a section f of I (which exists locally) then M[I] is (locally) just the f-torsion of M
	This comes from how we interpret the tensor dual of I
