Tangent sheaf rigidity
Fontaine-Wintenberger theory
Dalton's notes have precise formulation of almost etale descent
Firmly understand the one-variable case

Buzzard condition on sheafiness

Adic spaces help explain the notion of admissible cover for rigid analytic spaces
Key example: the nested increasing union of closed discs "is" an open cover of the open unit disc, but this cover is not admissible
Adic explanation: this cover is not an open cover in the adic sense -- there is a "rank 2" point on the open unit disc not seen by any of the smaller closed discs
