Relationship between Dold-Kan correspondence and derived categories
The categorization of spectral topological spaces is highly non-constructive
	Get concrete results in practice because of relationship between Spf and Spec

Almost mathematics
	Yoga of six functors
	Serre quotient and (categorical) localization
	Concrete realization of almost category (and stuff like almost Hom...)
	Flat "idempotent" ideals and pseudo-uniformizers
	"Content" and examples for higher rank valuations

Square zero extensions, derivations, and the universal property of the cotangent module (Kahler differentials)
	Jacobi-Zariski exact sequence
	Generalize this to the setting of topological commutative rings to think about the cotangent complex
	Functorial, (commutative) algebraic, and geometric properties of cotangent complex
	Approach of Andre-Quillen homology and abelian group objects

Check 1-dimensional Dieudonne module classification:
	Why does algebraic closure make things trivial?
	How does this relate to the classification of simple objects?
	Can we check conditions of Frobenius twists for \alpha_p, \mu_p, and \un{\Z/p}?

Let A be a (commutative) Hopf algebra over a perfect field k (equipped with Frob. \phi).
We have relative Frob. F: A^{(p)}\to A given by \lambda\tensor f\mapsto \lambda f^p.
Recall that A^{(p)}=k\tensor_{k,\phi}A is the Frobenius twist of A.
