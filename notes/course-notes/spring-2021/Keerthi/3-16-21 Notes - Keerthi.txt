Perfect complex - locally qis to bounded complex of finite free modules
	Exactly the compact objects
On regular scheme, any complex with bdd coherent cohomology is perfect
Think Koczul resolution for locally complete intersection
There are a host of different finiteness conditions that don't agree for non-regular schemes

In general, the perfect complexes form a Serre subcategory of the bbd coherent cohomology complexes

Complex of flat \neq flat complex

Thm (Lazard): Module if flat iff filtered colimit of finite free modules.

Bounded above complex of flat is K-flat.

Deligne - Hodge II (~ page 13) - full perspective on decolage - move the spectral sequence by one page
	Page 14 gives one perspective on what the pages of the spectral sequence are capturing

L\eta plays a role in the book of Berthelot-Ogus at the end
	Want to do this because of work of Kisin
	Mazur's Thm
	Interaction of Frobenius, Hodge filtration, and crystalline stuff

Theory of crystals: Roy --> Kisin
Geometrically recover Kisin's functor in the prismatic story

Thm of Ogus on crystalline cohomology - characterizing image of Frob

See Katz-Oda paper on Gauss-Manin connection

Pushforward to \O_{C_p} may not be well-behaved but it is once you apply L\eta

Original paper of Scholze on p-adic Hodge theory
Tate-Sen(?) theory
Almost etale descent

Cover by acyclic things
Over finite etale things faithfully flat descent and Galois descent are basically the same thing
	Fails for non-etale things
	Almost true for almost etale things

Finite free W(k)-module is generated by its Frobenius-invariants.

Thm (Bhatt-Scholze): Z_p-lattices in Galois representations of appropriate sort form category equivalent to category of prisms
	How do prisms relate to Breuil-Kisin-Fargues modules?

Look at higher pushforwards from crystalline to Zariski site to recover de Rham-Witt complex up to qis.
