Harris - notes on deformation theory that are very classical AG and informal
	Read: highly sketchy
Soul\'{e} gave some good lectures on arithmetic intersection theory
	He also has a book on Arakelov geometry

Bhatt and Conrad offer contrasting approaches to prove the Rigidity Thm (for abelian varieties)
	Both of them have notes on abelian varieties (both drawing largely from Mumford) that are both really good
Proof of general rigidity lemma given in notes of Mumford-Fogarty-Kirwan on Geometric Invariant Theory
So-called "absolute Pic functor" is never representable because of automorphisms

For representability of the relative Picard functor we need at least that all geometric fibers have no non-constant global sections
	We probably need this result relative to all pullbacks
Properness assumptions are probably necessary here because otherwise what does Pic^0 mean (i.e., how do we know we have finite dimensional cohomology)?
	We can maybe make sense of degree 0 without properness...
Do we need to sheafify the quotient or is it already sheafy?

Some technical things that came up that might be worth looking more into (since I don't understand them all that well):
	Semicontinuity and base change (c.f. Hartshorne)
	Compatibility of pushforward and "change in S" (for Cartesian diagrams)
	Stein factorization
		Zariski Connectedness Thm
		Theorem on formal functions
	Maybe require f: X\to S to be flat with some finiteness condition on the geometric fibers

The quotient X/G, as a functor, can be viewed in terms of G-torsors on X
	Here, G is a finite group acting freely on X (not in terms of the functor-of-points of X but rather the category induced by G)
	X/G is an example of a Zariski sheaf (it is in fact fppf) and is actually an algebraic space

Thought from Zachary regarding the above quotient stuff:
	One way to view the action of a (ordinary) group G on a set X is to think of G as a groupoid with one object (all of the elements become automorphisms via multiplication) and consider a functor from G to Set with target X
	Does this not work in the above setting as well, replacing Set by a more appropriate algebro-geometric category?

Comments from Ben:
	There's a valuative criterion for flatness
	Locally of finite presentation is a 'compactness' property in terms of maps to colimits or I guess maps from limits for schemes (rather than algebras)

Faltings-Chai shows that abelian algebraic spaces over a scheme S are (represented by) abelian schemes over S

Formal smoothness states things in terms of thickenings of affines, capturing a local property
	We ought to be able to check this on a cover, so we ought to be able to think about more general thickenings
