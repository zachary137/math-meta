Isogeny category of abelian varieties
	Poincare complete reducibility
		Uses dual abelian variety and choice of polarization to construct a suitable complement
	Semisimplicity of endomorphism algebras over Q
	Isogeny variant V_{\l}(A) of the Tate module T_{\l}(A)
Lefschetz principle
	In char. 0, statements about algebraic varieties over a field can often be reduced to statements about the same sort of objects over an algebraically closed field (typically \C)
	Admits various precise formulations
Berthelot-Breen-Messing
	Gives proof of result of Mazur-Messing-Oda
