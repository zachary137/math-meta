There is no good text on Shimura varieties
	Milne has a book...
	Christof Cornu(?) (he's French...) started writing a book at some point...
	Brian Conrad has some notes on CM for abelian varieties that might act as a good jumping off point
	Tate has some nice lecture notes on Stark's conjecture...

For isogeny we usually don't need to worry about flatness assumptions since we work with fppf stuff

Good way to view polarization is in terms of pulling back the Poincare bundle and getting something ample
	Works well over a general base
	Supposed to function like PSD bilinear form

Appel-Humbert
	Classification of line bundles on complex tori
	Can we canonically metrize the Poincare bundle in the complex setting? If so then this would make the Neron-Tate pairing story easy to see

Siegel modular forms and Siegel theta functions
	How do these relate to our story?

TO DO: Track down Brian Conrad's paper on Neron-Tate pairing
