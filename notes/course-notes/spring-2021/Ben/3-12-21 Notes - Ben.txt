Need right notion of length
	The thing I said initially was wrong (I always get confused about this...)
BC is wrong about putting p-torsion instead of order p
Don't need any multiplicative structure on k^2
Why should \alpha,\mu_p,\un{\Z/p} be a complete list over an algebraically closed field?
	Hint: Hilbert Thm 90
	Also, for Hilbert thm 90 stuff, what happens over a non-algebraically closed field? How exactly do we get non-isomorphic Dieudonne modules?
Q: Why is every elliptic curve over \ov{\F_p} either ordinary or supersingular?
	Hint: rule out the \'{e}tale case using the Weil pairing or something like that
Duality here is something worth thinking about
	What should the "natural" notion be (e.g., a pairing)?
	Concretely describe the dual
	Check compatibility of the dual
Describe the dual of \alpha_{p^n}
Check the construction of W_2^2
	Superscript 2 probably refers to kernel of Frob squared
	Subscript 2 probably refers to functor that takes k-alg R to the additive group (W_2(R),+)
Why are Cartier duality and Weil duality compatible for abelian varieties (in other words, why do they capture the same thing)?
I guess this depends on knowing how D is defined. How do we do that explicitly? Is there some semi-enlightening way to describe it?
In the case that Frob is an isomorphism we can descend from W(k) to Z_p
	This works in the etale case
