The Honda system stuff is trying to lift Hodge filtrations
The conditions are enough to rule out p-torsion for M/L
	Is this enough to get torsion-free in general?
We want L to be a direct summand of L
Condition (2) is equivalent to F(L+pM)=pM

There are diametrically opposite cases where the image of Frob and the Hodge filtration are far apart
Are image of Frob and the Hodge filtration always complementary? No? Supersingular elliptic curves?

The Hodge filtration here is defined in analogy of other Hodge filtrations
Frob-invariant differential forms

Grothendieck-Messing theory applies only when the divided powers are nilpotent or connected
	For p>2 the nilpotent condition is automatic, but it does not hold when p=2
	When p=2 we can impose connectivity to get ourselves in the right boat

The discrepancy seems to be due to the BC CMI notes rather than Oh

Rigidity thm follows from Maximum Principle
	We have a scheme theoretic analogue for proper things
	Think about the relationship between P^1 and A^1
Getting the geometric point is a result of faithfully flat descent
