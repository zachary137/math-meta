It's not true that the following categories are equivalent:
	p-divisible groups over Z_p
	p-divisible groups over F_p
What we do have is that the special fiber functor is fully faithful

We have equivalence of categories:
	connected p-divisible groups
	divisible formal Lie groups
Use this to lift group law in connected case
	How do we know we satisfy all of the axioms?
	Certainly there must be a lift by complicated deformation theory technology

For the special and general fiber stuff, the Noetherian hypothesis is absolutely essential
	Both theorems fail spectacularly without the Noetherian hypothesis
	\mu_{p^{\infty}} and Q_p/Z_p over Z_p^{\cycl} illustrate the difficulty

Scholze-Weinstein classify p-divisible groups over C_p

de Jong's theorem fails if we drop the discreteness of the valuation

Condition (2) ensures in some sense that we are n-truncated and not (n-1)-truncated

Grothendieck-Messing theory
	Describes deformations through nilpotent thickenings
	Needs the assumption that we have at least one deformation -- then we can describe all of them
	Grothendieck settled this issue with an annoying affine condition
	Theory of crystals

p-divisible groups also have something that behaves like de Rham cohomology, with the Lie algebra arising from this thing (this is the "crystal" which can be somewhat complicated)
Vector bundle comes with filtration analogous to Hodge filtration
Assuming S --> S' is a PD thickening, the miracle is that the vector bundle over S' only depends on the vector bundle over S
Reduces whole problem to doing linear algebra on the crystal, independent of choices of lift (assuming only that one exists)
