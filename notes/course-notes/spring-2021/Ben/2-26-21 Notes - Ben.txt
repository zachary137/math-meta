Need to devote some time to understanding Oh notes
Thm of Tate-Serre on equiv of categories for p-divisible groups and formal Lie groups
	Full faithfulness argument shows that we have a limit of Hopf algebras (need to think about coalg structure)

Need to check that completed(?) tensor product of two FPS rings is FPS ring
	Need the completion since tensor product of FPS rings is probably not FPS ring
	Can reduce to thinking over the residue field by (flat) complete Nakayama
	Key at the beginning is replacing (p^n)-torsion by kernel of Frob., which is more explicit
