Context: Oh's notes, especially surrounding Proposition 1.2.14 (formal smoothness of Pic^0)

There is a functorial version of the Rigidity Lemma that doesn't require the target to be representable
	Useful for working with things defined naturally by their functor-of-points (and which may not be representable)

We define Pic^0 in terms of the functor-of-points by having vanishing Euler characteristic -- What exactly does this mean?
	Euler characteristic of fibers
	Conrad gives some characterization in terms of Euler characteristic (in his notes on abelian varieties) that might be helpful

Degree 0 line bundles are those with a certain symmetry
	Multiplicative line bundles (I think this is the right term)

Degree 0 line bundles are in some sense "very far" from being ample
	Ample ~ positive Chern class ~ positive definite pairing
	Deg 0 ~ vanishing Chern class ~ trivial pairing

Triviality in the relative Picard means you are the pullback of a certain line bundle

Why does the deformation result work?
	This refers to Oh's written proof of the above named proposition
	The presence of H^2 signals that we are looking for compatibility of trivialization data for line bundles

David Hansen is a boss
	Just look at the overpowered stuff he used to do his proficiency exam

Notes from Sidd's GIST talk on the same day:
	One way to see where HOMFLY comes from is representations of quantum groups
	Incidence varieties and such (punctual Hilbert schemes) are good for generalizing zeta functions to work for curves with mild singularities
	Hilbert schemes and maps to compactified Jacobians
		Get projective bundle maps
		This is one way we see that the "integrals" we write down return polynomials
