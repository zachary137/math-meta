In char 0 having a flat connection is the same as having isomorphisms of all infinitesimal neighborhoods (of the diagonal embedding)

Crystalline site basically keeps track of infinitesimal thickenings with divided powers (to write down Taylor series)
Crystalline site does not have final object, but crystalline topos does

Crystals over F_p[x_1,...,x_n] correspond to vector bundles over Z_p[x_1,...,x_n]^ (p-adic completion) with flat connection

Bhatt-de Jong (comparison of crystalline and de Rham cohomology)
	Much easier than comparing the classical de Rham-Witt complex to crystalline cohomology

Q: Given a p-torsion-free ring A, under what conditions will the de Rham complex also be p-torsion-free?
