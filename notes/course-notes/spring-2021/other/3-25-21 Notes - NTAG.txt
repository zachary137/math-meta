Vakil Murphy's law
	Deformation spaces are often highly pathological, even when the objects of study are nice
Purity of moduli spaces
	Captures the idea that all components have the same dim
Boundary components of a moduli space tell us about degeneration behavior
Closures of components of a moduli space may not admit a nice modular (i.e., functorial) interpretation
	In other words, we don't necessarily know what the functor-of-points looks like
Deformation theory tells us that so-called Gorenstein families are well-behaved
