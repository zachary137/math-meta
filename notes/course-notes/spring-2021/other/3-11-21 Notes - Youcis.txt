Shimura varieties of abelian type
Modularity thm of Wiles (Conrad-Diamond-Taylor-Breuil)
Local Langlands conjecture (proof in special cases) relies on study of PEL Shimura varieties of GU(1,n-1)-type

Slogan: Deformation theory for suitably nice objects is the study of formal smoothness for the moduli space of those objects
Serre-Tate thm (in a nutshell): Deformation theory of abelian scheme is same as deformation theory of the associated p-divisible group
	Intuitive implication: formal local geometry of Shimura varieties is same as geometry of Rapoport-Zink spaces

Cartier dual G^D represents sHom(G,\G_m) in the category of abelian fppf sheaves
Q: What is the relationship between the Cartier dual and usual (Picard) dual of an abelian variety (and more generally an abelian scheme)?

Exercise: Let K:=\Q_p(\mu_p) (which has ramification index p-1).
	Show that \mu_p and \un{\Z_p} are isomorphic over K but not over \O_K.

Approaches to formal geometry:
	Pseudocompact rings
	Pseudofinite rings
	Nilpotent rings
	Complete adic rings
	Etc.

Restricting attention to p-divisible groups, there is a near-perfect p-adic local field analogue of Riemann's classification of abelian varieties over \C
