Borel-Moore homology (related if we consider more typical dualizing sheaf)
Cosheaf condition
Verdier duality
"Flavors" of sheaves
	Injective
	Flabby = flasque
	Soft
	c-soft
Our Borel-Moore-type theory captures singular and dual compactly supported singular homology at the same time
	Closed sets give one and open sets the other
	Illustrates some of the utility of locally closed sets
