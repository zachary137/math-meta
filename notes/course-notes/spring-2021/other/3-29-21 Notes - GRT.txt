Recollement
	Grothendieck's yoga of six functors/operations
Forms of duality:
	Coherent duality
	Verdier duality
	Poincare duality
Important sheaves:
	Orientation sheaf (local and global version)
	Dualizing sheaf
	IC sheaf (IC = intersection cohomology)

Putting bounds on cohomology (relative to 0) naturally gives a t-structure on the bounded derived category of constructible sheaves
