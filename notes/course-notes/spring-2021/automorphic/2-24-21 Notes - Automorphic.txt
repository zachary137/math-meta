Microlocal analysis
	Play off functions against their Fourier transform
	Compare things like supports
	Maybe we make things nice locally somewhere at the cost of "niceness" somewhere else
	Manifests in physics as uncertainty principles

Ask Bjorn how he does live notes (Dropbox paired with iPad note app...)

Kudla's summary of Tate's thesis - An Introduction to the Langlands Program
	Gives canonical way of conceptualizing epsilon comparison factors
	Way more than just a summary, with lots of insight not originally present in the thesis

The global-local perspective gives us a much better way to see where the functional equations come from

Siegel-Minkowski formula for quadratic forms (connection to Tamagawa measure)

Tate has an excellent paper on residue pairings for curves
	Reference?
