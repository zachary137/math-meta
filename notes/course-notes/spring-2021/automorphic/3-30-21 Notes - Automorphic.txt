Paley-Wiener Thm is a result on growth conditions
	Possibly related to cuspidality
Bernstein variety generalizes part of Tate's thesis in which \eta part of quasicharacter controls connected component
	Where did \eta and "ramifiedness" go for n>1?
Rankin-Selberg theory tells us about the relationship between representations and the location and order of poles of associated zeta integrals
	Nature of poles described by subrepresentations of induction from appropriate cuspidals
See Getz and Hahn for results on how matrix coefficients recover representations
	How much do the matrix coefficients know about the representation from which they come?
[Luo] and [Wang] seem to present genuinely different approaches to proving the functional equation
	Can we reconcile the two approaches? Are they actually all that different?
	When are the various local factors trivial (epsilon, gamma, L)? How can we describe them more generally?
Where does the discrepancy arise for the cases n=1 and n>1?
	What does Luo mean by \pi+{s+(n-1)/2}?
	What fails for n=1?
	How is duality related to compact support for parabolic induction?
		Need associated integrals to converge for pairings to make sense
		Similar to stuff for cohomology classes in de Rham theory
Typos and deficiencies for [Luo]
	GCD result -- What does it actually take to show we have a fractional ideal?
	We have independence from s specifically because of how K_0 is chosen
	When do we just recover \C[q^{\pm s}] as our fractional ideal? That is, when is our Euler factor equal to 1?
