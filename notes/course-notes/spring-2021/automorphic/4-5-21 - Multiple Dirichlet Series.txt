Multiple Dirichlet Series

Dirichlet series associated to "nice" classes of sequences "mimic" the Riemann zeta function in one of two ways
1. A sum over n\geq1 is a product over primes p with the factors in the product looking like 1/P(p^{-s}) for P(x)\in C[x]
	Coefficients of P depend on the prime but the degree of P is invariant
2. MC + FE between s and k-s for some k

In broad strokes, these things arise from the theory of automorphic forms

New idea: Twist the Dirichlet series by multiplying by a residue symbol
	Obtain a series now of two complex variables
	The trivial representation does have a part to play here (when we interchange the order of summation) but its role is rather subtle

For quadratic twists (using Kronecker symbols) we get a finite (generally non-abelian) group of functional equations
	No natural cohomological interpretation of these symmetries is known

Here are some other cases:
	Kac-Moody algebras appear and we have infinite FE groups
	For higher degree residue symbols, we involve nth order Gauss sums
		Obtains FE groups such as S_n
		Connections to quantum groups, crystal graphs, so-called integrable systems

Continue the classical Dirichlet series L(s,\chi_N) to make sense of the value at 1/2 and try to understand what it is
Lindelof hypothesis in twisted aspect: L(1/2,\chi_N)=O(N^{\epsilon})
We can associate various multiple Dirichlet series to this
	Continuation has been proved up to k=3
	Continuation is conjectured to be obstructed by a single essential singularity for k\geq4 (for s=1/2)
	In general, in terms of two complex variables, we get a plane of obstructions

The value 1/2 appears since it is the fixed point of s \mapsto 1-s (this is the sense in which it is "central")

A common technique is to look at 1/2+it for t a real parameter (basically, move on the critical line in the middle of the critical strip)
	I'm not sure if this is related but for things related to the Riemann hypothesis (and GRH) you usually only need to be able to move in by \epsilon on the edges of the critical strip

Linked things (maybe?)
	Hamburger's Thm (Is that how you spell it...?)
	Converse-type theorems

The a(n)'s come from Hecke newforms for GL_2
For GL_n we use Satake

The two variables s,w interact in a somewhat complicated way (things are not necessarily "separable")

There are some Eisenstein series lurking in the background, at least by analogy
	Can't bring to bear the full structural power of Eisenstein series, unfortunately
	Eisenstein series related to Whittaker coefficients (IDK what these are...)
