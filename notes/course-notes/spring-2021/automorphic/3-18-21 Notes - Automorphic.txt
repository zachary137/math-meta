Tamagawa measures exist for a large class of algebraic groups
	For which ones does it fail to exist?
	The naive guess may not always work since it may not converge (when we combine all local factors)
	Often want to normalize so that a desired object has measure 1
Look at meromorphic extension of global zeta function
	Only poles at exponent 0,1 for unitary connected component of Riemann surface of characters
Moving between K and K^{\times} is a simple matter since we just add and subtract a single term as appropriate
	This should be thought of as adding boundary when we move from K^{\times} to K
	Dealing with added boundary is more subtle in Godement-Jacquet theory
	One general sentiment behind BKN program is that we need to handle added boundary carefully

Geometry of numbers tells us that vol(\A_1^{\times}/K^{\times}) has an explicit form involving interesting invariants (c.f. [Lang, pg. 294])
Let C be a nice algebraic curve over a global function field F_q(t)
	Residue of Z_C(t) (curve zeta function) at t=1 is #Jac(C)/(q-1)

Matter of combining global adelic theory and local theory is a bit subtle
	Global picture knows about all Schwartz-Bruhat theory and so is "too general" to capture all relevant number theoretic information found in the local case
