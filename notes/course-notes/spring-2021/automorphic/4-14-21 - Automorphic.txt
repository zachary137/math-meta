Context:
	First half was my lecture wrapping up nonarchimedean local Godement-Jacquet theory
	Second half was Elad going through his slides motivating the local Langlands correspondence

First half

What information do the matrix coefficients of a representation see? What do they not see?
	This is partly answered by the Peter-Weyl Thm and Complete Reducibility Thm
	Helpful to know since this informs the limits of what we can expect from the simple local zeta integrals we have defined

Vocabulary:
	Series types
		Continuous
		Discrete
		Complementary
	New form (in context of theory of modular forms)
	Kirillov model
	Whittaker model
	Mirabolic subgroup (Elad mentioned the utility of this...)

Do the above give more "natural/general/insightful" ways of constructing zeta integrals (or similar objects)?

Here's a nice source that works things out concretely and explicitly
	Goldfeld-Hundley - Automorphic Representations and L-Functions for the General Linear Group

Here's a helpful source of videos for learning about Godement-Jacquet theory and the BKN program

Slides from Elad's talk will be added to the Canvas webpage
	These are super well-written -- I'm definitely stealing them for the future (with proper accreditation, of course)

Harish-Chandra's philosophy
	This applies must to cusp forms (What are these again) but can be adapted to work for other kinds of objects
	1. Construct all supercuspidal representations
	2. Construct all other representations from the supercuspidals

Here are the settings that are often of interest (What does our base field look like):
	Finite
	Local, nonarchimedean
	Local, archimedean
	Global, number field
	Global, (global) function field
Global function fields are nice because everything is locally nonarchimedean and tools from algebraic geometry can be most directly brought to bear
Number fields and archimedean local fields are nice because they are amenable to powerful tools from analysis
Finite fields are nice because there are no issues of convergence

As a prelude to the local or global setting, it is sometimes insightful to first work with so-called finite groups of Lie type
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Lie_type
That being said, there are many results which have been proven in the local/global (especially local) setting that have finite analogues which are mostly unexplored
	Common for advisors to give these finite analogues to starting students as toy problems

One big challenge when working over number fields is that there are analytical arguments that we don't know how to handle using purely geometric methods
When things are geometric we can fruitfully put geometric tools to use
	This might sound tautological and to a certain extent it is
	However, there is great potential for utility if we can characterize geometric properties in terms of other "non-geometric" data
	I'm not sure how directly related this is but Daniel Litt has some results on arithmetic monodromy that focus a lot on representations that "arise from geometry" in a certain precise sense

Irreducible cuspidal representations arise from cohomology of so-called Deligne-Lusztig varieties
	This supposedly has the advantage of being very hands-on, at least in simple cases

Big (and maybe small) results worth knowing more about:
	Arthur's work on trace formulae and endoscopic lifts
	Converse Thm of Piatetski-Shapiro
	Work of Jacquet-Liu tackling Jacquet's conjecture (I didn't catch what this is about...)
