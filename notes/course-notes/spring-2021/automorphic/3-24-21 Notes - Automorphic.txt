Averaging process = generalized analogue of induction of representations (Eisenstein series)
Discrete vs. continuous spectrum
How am I supposed to think about the zoo of automorphic objects?

What is the relationship between the notions of cuspidal and supercuspidal?
	Cuspidal imposes growth conditions that may be met without being supercuspidal
	Relationship between Jacquet functor/module and extraction/inversion of Fourier coefficients
	Connection to theory of modularity

What does push-pull and algebraic geometry stuff have to do with the more analytical aspects of number theory?
	Middle ground is (sometimes) physics!

What are the representations of GL_1, possibly with conditions attached?
	Smooth
	Admissible
	Irreducible
	Supercuspidal (+Irreducible)
How about GL_2?
