For more on the intertwining approach and the fact that our desired Hom space is 1-dim, see Kudla's writeup on Tate's thesis

Here are three approaches to tackling local Godement-Jacquet theory in the nonarchimedean case:
1. Reduce to the supercuspidal case using parabolic induction and then filter the Schwartz space for M_n(F) in a nice way to work with all test functions [Luo]
2. Reduce to the supercuspidal case using parabolic induction and then work with a nice class of test functions that is large enough to deduce the functional equation [Wang and Godement-Jacquet]
3. Make use of the explicit classification of irreducible admissible representations for GL_n(F)

Finding good test functions is an important yet somewhat subtle business:
	RaphaÃ«l Beuzart-Plessis - results on relaxing conditions on test functions
		Peter Sarnak also has some results in this vein

Multiplicativity of local \gamma-factors is an important phenomenon that helps us pass from the local to the global setting
	Sahidi has an interesting paper on this

In the coming weeks, Mishty will be speaking on this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06091
	Goal is to get nice version of the Poisson Summation Formula for the BKN program
