S(\GL_n(F)) := locally constant compactly supported functions on M_n(F) restricted to \GL_n(F)
	Not the same as Schwartz functions on \GL_n(F) since restriction does not necessarily respect compactness (open immersions are not proper in general)
	Think about \O_F vs. \O_F^{\times}
	Worth looking into as a point of contrast between [Luo] and [Wang]
Cochar. \lambda of alg. grp. G gives rise to parabolic P(\lambda) defined as points of G where "t-->0 limit" of the \lambda action exists
	How does this correspond to being the stabilizer of a flag?
The supercuspidality condition can be rephrased as some integral over all unipotents vanishes (after defining everything correctly). This is a local analogue of cuspidal automorphic form
	Rephrasing here comes from unpacking construction of the Jacquet module
Example construction: supercuspidal representation of \GL_2(\F_q)
	C.f. Thm 6.2 of this paper: http://users.ictp.it/~pub_off/lectures/lns021/Prasad/Prasad.pdf
	In positive char., this technique can be generalized to construct all supercuspidal representations for \GL_2
Compact induction imposes compact support on the quotient homogeneous space (we may not be dealing with a normal subgroup)
"Normalized Jacquet module"
	Twist by modular quasichar. to the -1/2 to make Frobenius Reciprocity easier to state
	Modular quasichar. also arises to relate behavior of induction with taking the contragredient, as well as carry over unitarizability
Induction helps us construct non-examples of supercuspidal representations
This is some general construction; any Borel will only have 1-dimensional irreducible representations because solvable algebraic groups are so called "trigonalizable"
	Related to so-called Steinberg representation
Ind(\pi_1 â€¦ \pi_n) in general is irreducible for \pi_1,...,\pi_n supercuspidal irreducible if and only if \pi_i is not isomorphic to \pi_j \cdot |\det|

What is the full significance of the multiplicativity of the local \gamma-factors?
How do local \gamma-factors change when we modify the input parameters?
	Bernstein variety -- Is there natural choice of topology/geometry for space of (maybe some adjectives here...) representations of \GL_n(F)?
Local Euler factors (L-functions)
	n=1 case handled by Tate's thesis
	n>1 case we just get 1 (so it's not interesting; fortunately the local \epsilon-factor is interesting!)
The decomposition of the Haar measure according to the Iwasawa decomposition is a non-trivial fact. You can find it for instance in Bump's book page 138
	C.f. also Getz and Hahn Proposition 3.2.1
If C(.) gives functions that are locally constant with compact support then C takes Cartesian products to tensor products
	...at least for matrices using indicator function decompositions
How can we generalize the rank stratification of \GL_n?
	Role of the boundary in the BKN program
	Connection to theory of perverse sheaves?
