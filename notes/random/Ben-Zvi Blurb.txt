Some version of Poincare duality (under nice conditions) relating the theories of Weil divisors and (effective) Cartier divisors
A line bundle with a distinguished atlas is the same data as a Cech cohomology class for the unit sheaf associated to the structure sheaf
Torsion-free line bundles (maybe even for higher rank) over smooth curves are necessarily locally free, which need not be the case for schemes of higher dimension
There are several ways to describe Chern classes, line bundles, Abel-Jacobi maps, etc. in the holomorphic case, all of which coincide
The union of the coordinate axes in A^2 is an interesting and poorly behaved space in many ways

C.f. Chriss and Ginzburg, Representation Theory and Complex Geometry for exposition on the following:
A G_m-equivariant affine scheme is the same thing as a graded ring
There is an equivalence of categories between the category of G_m-equivariant line bundles on A^1 and the category of filtered modules with exhaustive filtration
This gives motivation for Rees construction since functor relates exhaustively filtered module with its associated graded
We obtain flat degeneration which is an isomorphism everywhere except at 0, where we get the associated graded

Category theory approach to G_m makes presence of graded rings more intuitive.
Discussion of weighted projective spaces.
Discussion of extra data needed to think of Proj as an adjoint.
Gives some geometric and algebraic applications of Proj.

Suppose we are working in positive characteristic p.
Let A be a perfect F_p-algebra and f an element of A. 
Then, the localization A_f is also a perfect F_p-algebra because inverting an element also inverts all powers of that element.
This has important implications for rational open Cech covers of perfect analytic spaces (we might need to modify the adjectives here).

Let X=Spec k[w,x,y,z]/(wz-xy) and consider the sections defined on D(y) and D(w) by z/y and x/w, respectively. 
These glue to give a section defined on the union of D(y) and D(w). 
Why is this section not globally cut out by a single equation?

Rigid geometry sits somewhere between Spec k[[t]] and Spf k[[t]] = colim Spec k[t]/t^n 
One is a local disc which still carries a generic point while the other is a formal disc where the generic point has been cut out in some sense to make the disc "extra local"

Q: Which functors can we build from representable ones?

qcqs pushforward of qcoh is qcoh
projective pushforward of coh is coh

On a Noetherian scheme, does qcqs imply projective?

Different perspectives:
Sieves (tell me how to restrict)
Cech descent data (tell me how to glue along intersections)
