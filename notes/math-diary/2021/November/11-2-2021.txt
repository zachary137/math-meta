---Meeting with Keerthi---
Student of Ayoub has some result on rigid motives
	Some kind of tilting correspondence
	Says that this is somehow a topological notion
Exponential motives
Student of Bhatt has stacky approach to integral cohomology theories (says over F_p)
	Somehow things are encoded by quasi-ideals (not exactly sure what these are but I think Drinfeld gives a definition)
Prismatic perspective on Bruhat-Tits buildings
	Readable reference of Bruhat-Tits theory: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?rep=rep1&type=pdf&doi=10.1.1.217.9089
	Fargues-Fontaine curve should play a foundational role that cleans things up significantly

Are there suitable conditions we can put on a rigid analytic space to make it behave like a Kahler manifold?
	What properties do we want to transfer over (e.g., Hodge symmetry)?
