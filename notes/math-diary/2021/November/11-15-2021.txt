Does the universal property of divided power algebras naturally also us to relate with symmetric and exterior algebras?

What is it about rigid analytic motives that Keerthi believes we should be able to extract and employ?
	Want a notion of motivic cohomology that works for a general class of diamonds (maybe locally spacial, etc.) and in particular Bun_G
		This would be where cycle classes live
		Want to have intersection product and other such tools to work with
		This would explain why Shimura cycles are as they are

Can we define condensed analogs of abelian varieties/schemes that are "rigid" in a manner similar to their classical counterparts?

Perfect qcoh sheaves (need this if we want to do algebraic K-theory)
	One must determine the appropriate setting for applying Grothendieck's construction

Every derived ring has an underlying H\Z-algebra in spectra
H\F_2\tensor H\F_2 (tensor product of Eilenberg-MacLane spectra) is not a derived ring
	Has to do with DL action
