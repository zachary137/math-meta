	Excellent source of exposition in its own right
	Main inspiration for this talk
	Provides good summary of introductory literature for further reading

Goal: "algebraic" theory of "p-adic manifolds"

Want BOTH of the following to be open:
	{x : f(x) \neq 0}
	{x : |f(x)| \leq 1}

Closed unit disc should be: 
	Connected
	Quasi-compact (same as compact, for the non-algebraic geometers in the room)

Topological properties
Picard group
Dimension
Functor-of-points

The closed unit disk
The punctured closed disk
The multi-punctured disk
The open disk
Affine space
Projective space
The multiplicative group
Tate elliptic curves

Warning: Irreducible rigid analytic spaces are relatively rare!
	This means that we will not be able to follow the standard practice of working with generic points.

Classical theory of covering spaces
	Establishes conditions on base topological space giving correspondence: 
		discrete fibrations over the (dual of the) fundamental groupoid
		actual topological spaces over the base space
