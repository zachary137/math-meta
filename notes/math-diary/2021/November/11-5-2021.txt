---Random torsor stuff---
Construct an example of GL_2-torsor whose associated automorphism group is group of invertible elements in a quaternion algebra

Let H be a group scheme over Spec B which is an fppf sheaf and assume BH has affine diagonal.
	Then, H is the fiber product of * with itself over BH (in the sense of groupoids).
	The induced map from H to * is fppf.
	* here is just Spec B.
	* --> BH is trivial H-torsor.
	The point is that H is canonically given by automorphisms of the trivial H-torsor.

---Thing from Tobi---
Z_p{t} = Z_p[[t]] \cap Hol(C)
	What topology should we put on it?
	Should it have any kind of nice moduli-theoretic interpretation?
