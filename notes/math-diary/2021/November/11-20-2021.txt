According to Scholze...
	If we want a global char. 0 shtuka then we need to look at a paper of Kottwitz thinking about compatible lobal BG (classifying stack) with some kind of global reciprocity law encoding compatibility

Thinking in terms of test objects, p-completion tells us to restrict attention to p-nilpotent test objects

---Conversation with Sidd---
Broadly speaking, Sidd is interested in zeta functions (and values) and their relationship to "stacky" point counts
Want to compactify Bun_G in a suitable way (e.g., accounting for singularities) and take stacky point count
	Sidd has a formula for certain smooth curves
	Sidd has a conjectural formula for the cuspidal cubic

Key players: Hilbert and motivic zeta functions

Papers with results worth contextualizing and generalizing
	Altman-Kleiman - compactification of Pic^0
	Two papers of Zhiwei Yun
	Paper of Lurie-Gaitsgory
	Atiyah - stacky classification of vector bundles over elliptic curves for SL_2(C)

Does Beauville-Lazslow play any role here?
