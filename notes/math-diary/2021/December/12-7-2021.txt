Don't need \twid{B} in the (Lurie) definition of small/infinitesimal extension
	Really what matters are the sections s, since we can recover everything from this (better looks like classical setting)

o(f) is the obstruction class (for f flat morphism of classical guys)
	In the commutative square, both vertical maps are flat and both horizontal maps are square-zero

Ext^i(M,N) = \pi_0 Hom(M,N[i])

For the deformation theory story, we take the \pi_0 of the associated Mor in stacks (get pointed maps...)

This is all to get a derived geometric interpretation of the obstruction class

Should be able to formulate our morphism property more intrinsically, using cotangent complex

Beware that there are different standards for "measuring" amplitude
	[-1,0] and [0,1] could mean the same thing but in different contexts

VCD has modified universal property from the classical case
	Looking at all maps instead of just ones arising from effective Cartier divisors

What is the "meaning" of the second condition in the definition of VCD?
	Shift by -1 should be related to conormal sheaf
	Maybe Koszul duality...

Intrinsic normal cone
	https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9601010
	Behrend and Fantechi give an older construction that might be compatible...

I should point out one reason we might care about derived deformations over classical ones
	Rigidity of abelian schemes not seen if we look at the broader setting of extensions
	Flesh out the details here...
	Connection to Lie algebras, mathematical physics, etc.

What is the geometric understanding of the Weil restriction?

BG_{m,X} classifies line bundles on X with a section
[A_X^1/G_{m,X}] classifies... line bundles with a section (maybe not...)

Arithmetic Chow group related to Fourier expansion of vector-valued modular form
WTF do we actually mean by a Fourier expansion? By a function-sheaf correspondence?

Can we gain access to integral Chow groups using spectral methods (in the sense of homotopy theory)?
