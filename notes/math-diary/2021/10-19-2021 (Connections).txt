connections <---> connection forms (certain kinds of g-valued 1-forms)
horizontal lifts of vector fields on the base space
	relative to a principal bundle with distinguished connection (given by choice of subbundle)
holonomy comes from lifting paths for the projection of a principal bundle
	we get a subgroup in the diffeomorphism group of the fiber
	restricted holonomy group comes from looking at contractible paths
	holonomy group is some subgroup of G (this is not canonical; we get a conjugacy class)
	holonomy group does not depend on the regularity of the paths we are lifting, so is some sense a topological gadget
		well almost -- the only difference between \pi_1 and the holonomy group has to do with curvature (so no curvature means holonomy = homotopy)
curvature form
	flat = curvature form vanishes
	same as horizontal subbundle being involutive (in the sense of being closed under the Lie bracket)
structure equation
	Maurer-Cartan equations
modified form of everything for vector bundles
	get parallel transport
	subbundle is flat if it is involutive (by definition)
next time
	duality
	curvature form on vector bundles
	Ambrose-Singer Thm (fundamentally relates curvature and holonomy)
