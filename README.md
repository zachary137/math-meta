# math-meta

This is a place for me to store and organize math-related things of personal interest. There are several important sections.

## archive

This is where I store information about web content I have preserved using the Wayback Machine.

## notes

This is where I store my notes for courses, talks, etc. Some notes are unfinished or really unpolished (even containing errors!), so use at your own risk.

## professional

This is where I store professional documents like my CV, research statement, teaching statement, etc.

## teaching

This is where I store current and old teaching materials.
