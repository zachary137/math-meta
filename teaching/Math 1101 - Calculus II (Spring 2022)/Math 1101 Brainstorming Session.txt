Keep attendance for the first few lab sessions

Sister commencement and final exam scheduling - discuss with Juliana
Is lab something I do jointly with Matt -- i.e., are we there at the same time?

Specify which times I can be available to do OH
	Three hours (give four or five possible hours)
	Time slots should be tied with assignments

Might need to talk with students explicitly when the mandatory mask period ends when February comes around
	Send reminder to the students before first meeting with them

How should we communicate with students about COVID concerns before the start of the semester?
	C.f. Google form that Ethan sent out as a reference

Students can collaborate on hw and most other assignments but need to independently do write-ups

Group assignments
	Choose three problems
	One submission per group
	Due end of the day on the following TH

Heavy OH days
	M - WebWork
	F - HW

Small groups
	Let the students choose
	Get feedback from students about their group assignments (Google feedback form)
	Encourage students to put their names at the top
	Cement groups during the second lab

All grading will be done through Gradescope

Communicate with Juliana about the boycott stuff after the grad student discussion on W

For Math 1101, it might be better to do use ... (and list out the first few terms) rather than write things out precisely with a formula
